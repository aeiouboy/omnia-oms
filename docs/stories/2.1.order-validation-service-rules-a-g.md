# Story 2.1: Order Validation Service (Rules A-G)

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** order processing system,  
**I want** to validate incoming orders against QC SMF business rules,  
**so that** only valid orders proceed through the processing pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Rule A**: OrderID validation - unique identifier format and uniqueness check
2. **Rule B**: ShipFromLocationID consistency validation across all line items
3. **Rule C**: IsForceAllocation validation - must be set to True for all QC SMF orders (Field standardization: ensure `IsForceAllocation` not `IsForceAllocate`)
4. **Rule D**: T1MembershipID validation - optional field with format validation when provided
5. **Rule E**: T1Number validation - optional fulfillment center reference validation
6. **Rule F**: CustRef validation - optional Slick integration reference validation
7. **Rule G**: CustomerID validation - optional MAO customer profile validation with external lookup
8. Validation error responses with specific field details for correction guidance
9. Failed validation orders routed to dead letter queue with retry capability
10. Validation processing completed within <50ms per order for performance targets

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.1 builds on the order reception service (Story 1.4) and implements the first step of the 9-step order processing workflow defined in the PRD.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 2 - Order Processing Engine]
- **Validation Rules**: Comprehensive A-G rule validation for QC SMF business requirements
- **Performance**: <50ms per order validation processing for pipeline efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Dead letter queue integration with retry capability
- **Integration**: External validation with MAO customer profile lookup

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Service Architecture]
- **Framework**: Node.js microservice with Fastify framework
- **Validation**: Custom validation engine with business rule enforcement
- **Database**: PostgreSQL integration for uniqueness checks and lookups
- **External APIs**: MAO integration for customer profile validation

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Validation processing within <50ms per order
- Support for 1000+ orders per minute processing capacity
- <0.1% system error rate for critical validation functions
- External API timeout and fallback handling

### Business Rules Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 2 Context]
The validation service implements:
- QC SMF-specific business rules (Rules A-G)
- Force allocation enforcement for all orders
- Optional field validation with graceful handling
- Integration with external systems for comprehensive validation

### Validation Rule Details
[Source: PRD Functional Requirements]
- **Rule A**: OrderID format and uniqueness for order tracking
- **Rule B**: Location consistency for fulfillment coordination
- **Rule C**: Force allocation flag for QC SMF operational requirements
- **Rules D-G**: Optional field validation with external integration support

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Unit testing for each validation rule with comprehensive coverage
- Integration testing for external API validation (MAO customer lookup)
- Performance testing to validate <50ms processing target
- Error handling testing for DLQ integration and retry logic

#### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `src/validation/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/validation/`
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/validation/`

#### Testing Frameworks
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Supertest for API endpoint testing
- Custom utilities for validation rule testing
- Load testing for performance validation
