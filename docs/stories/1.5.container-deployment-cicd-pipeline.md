# Story 1.5: Container Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want** to establish containerized deployment with automated CI/CD,  
**so that** services can be deployed reliably and efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Docker multi-stage builds created for Node.js services with Alpine base images
2. Azure Container Apps configured with auto-scaling policies
3. CI/CD pipeline implemented with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps
4. Automated testing integration in pipeline (unit tests, security scans)
5. Blue-green or rolling deployment strategy implemented
6. Environment-specific configuration management (dev, staging, prod)
7. Container registry integration with vulnerability scanning
8. Service discovery and internal communication configured
9. SSL/TLS certificates automated with Azure Key Vault integration
10. Deployment rollback procedures documented and tested

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.5 builds on the infrastructure (Story 1.1), database (Story 1.2), Kafka (Story 1.3), and order service (Story 1.4) to provide deployment capabilities for the complete system.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure]
- **Platform**: Azure Container Apps with auto-scaling capabilities
- **Strategy**: Blue-green or rolling deployment for zero-downtime
- **Registry**: Azure Container Registry with vulnerability scanning
- **Pipeline**: GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for CI/CD automation

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]
- **Containers**: Docker with multi-stage builds and Alpine base images
- **Orchestration**: Azure Container Apps with managed scaling
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps with automated testing
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault for secrets and certificate management

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Zero-downtime deployments with health check validation
- Auto-scaling capabilities for 1000+ orders/minute capacity
- Deployment rollback within <5-minute recovery time
- Container security scanning and vulnerability management

### Deployment Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 1 Context]
The deployment system provides:
- Reliable containerized deployment for all microservices
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Automated testing and security validation
- Foundation for production-ready operations

### Security Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]
- Container vulnerability scanning and compliance
- SSL/TLS certificate automation and management
- Secure secret management with Azure Key Vault
- Network security and service isolation

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Deployment pipeline testing with validation scenarios
- Container security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- End-to-end deployment testing across environments
- Rollback testing and disaster recovery validation

#### Test File Locations
