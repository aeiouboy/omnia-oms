# Story 2.8: Order Status Management & Event Publishing

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** order processing system,  
**I want** to maintain accurate order status with regional coordination,  
**so that** all stores have real-time visibility into order processing progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Order status tracking through sequential progression (1000 → 2000 → 3000)
2. Atomic status updates with proper database transaction management
3. Status change event publishing to order.status.v1 Kafka topic (Updated: Standardize from generic queue.publishOrderEvent to specific topic routing)
4. Regional coordination messaging for multi-store visibility (Enhanced: Add Thailand region support with CFR organization integration)
5. Status history maintenance with complete audit trail and timestamps
6. Status validation preventing invalid status transitions
7. Bulk status update capabilities for operational efficiency
8. Status query APIs with filtering and pagination support
9. Status-based order lifecycle management and automated workflows
10. Status update processing within <10ms per order for real-time coordination

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.8 completes Epic 2 by implementing the status management and event publishing system that coordinates with all previous stories (2.1-2.7) to provide real-time order visibility across the QC SMF system.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 2 - Order Processing Engine]
- **Status Progression**: Sequential 1000 → 2000 → 3000 status flow
- **Performance**: <10ms per order status update processing
- **Coordination**: Regional messaging for multi-store visibility
- **Audit**: Complete status history and audit trail

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Service Architecture]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for status tracking and history
- **Messaging**: Kafka event publishing for status coordination
- **APIs**: RESTful status query APIs with filtering
- **Transaction**: Atomic status updates with proper consistency

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Status update processing within <10ms per order
- Support for 1000+ orders per minute status capacity
- Real-time regional coordination and visibility
- Bulk operations for operational efficiency

### Status Management Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 2 Context]
The status management service provides:
- Sequential status progression with validation
- Real-time event publishing for coordination
- Regional multi-store visibility and synchronization
- Complete audit trail and lifecycle management

### QC SMF Status Requirements
[Source: PRD Functional Requirements]
- **Status 1000**: Open (initial order receipt)
- **Status 2000**: Allocated (after force allocation)
- **Status 3000**: Released (after single release creation)
- **Regional Sync**: Multi-store visibility and coordination

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Unit testing for status management logic and validation
- Integration testing for status event publishing
- Performance testing to validate <10ms status update target
- Bulk operation testing for operational scenarios

#### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `src/status/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/status/`
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/status/`

#### Testing Frameworks
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Custom status testing utilities
- Kafka event testing for status coordination
- Load testing for status performance validation
