## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story context available - this is the first story in the project.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]
- **Platform:** Microsoft Azure with Southeast Asia deployment (Singapore primary, Thailand secondary)
- **Key Services:** Azure Container Apps, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Cache for Redis, Azure Application Insights, Azure API Management

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ for primary transactional database with ACID compliance
- **Cache:** Redis 7.2+ for session storage and caching with high-performance in-memory data structure store
- **IaC Tool:** Azure Bicep for Infrastructure as Code with Azure-native IaC and strong typing
- **Monitoring:** Azure Application Insights for application performance monitoring with full-stack observability

### Performance Requirements  
[Source: architecture.md#Technical Summary]
- System must achieve <100ms order validation and 99.9% uptime
- Database optimization required with connection pooling and query indexing
- Response time target: <100ms for order validation, <200ms for complex queries (P99)

### Infrastructure Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#High Level Architecture Diagram]
The system uses event-driven microservices architecture with:
- Azure Event Hubs for Kafka-compatible messaging
- PostgreSQL for transactional data
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Azure Container Apps for service hosting
- Azure API Management for gateway functionality

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Security and Authentication]
- Network security groups and private networking for service isolation
- SSL/TLS termination at Application Gateway
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
- Secure secret management with Azure Key Vault integration

### Environment Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#Deployment Architecture]
- Development, staging, and production environments required
- Blue-green or rolling deployment strategy implementation
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Container registry integration with vulnerability scanning

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Infrastructure validation tests for all deployed resources
- Health check validations for all services
- Performance testing to validate <100ms response targets
- Security testing for network isolation and access controls

#### Test File Locations
- Infrastructure tests: `infrastructure/tests/`
- Bicep template validation: `infrastructure/modules/tests/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/infrastructure/`

#### Testing Frameworks
- Azure Resource Manager template testing
- Bicep validation and linting tools
- Infrastructure integration testing with actual Azure resources
- Automated deployment pipeline validation
