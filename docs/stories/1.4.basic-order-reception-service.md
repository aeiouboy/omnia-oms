# Story 1.4: Basic Order Reception Service

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system developer,  
**I want** to create a basic order consumer service,  
**so that** orders can be received from Kafka and stored in the database.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Node.js microservice created with Fastify framework and TypeScript
2. Kafka consumer implemented for order.create.v1 topic consumption
3. Basic order validation for required fields (OrderID, ShipFromLocationID)
4. Order persistence to PostgreSQL with proper error handling
5. Order status initialized to 1000 (Open) upon successful storage
6. Correlation ID tracking for distributed tracing across services
7. Dead letter queue integration for failed message processing
8. Health check endpoints for container orchestration
9. Structured logging with Winston for centralized log aggregation
10. Unit tests covering order reception and basic validation scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.4 builds on the database schema (Story 1.2) and Kafka infrastructure (Story 1.3) to create the first microservice for order processing.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure]
- **Framework**: Node.js with Fastify for high-performance HTTP server
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and development productivity
- **Consumer**: Kafka consumer for order.create.v1 topic consumption
- **Status**: Initialize orders to status 1000 (Open) for workflow processing

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ with TypeScript for type safety
- **Framework**: Fastify for high-performance HTTP operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL integration with connection pooling
- **Logging**: Winston for structured logging with correlation IDs

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Support for 1000+ orders per minute processing capacity
- <100ms order validation response time requirements
- Distributed tracing with correlation ID propagation
- Comprehensive error handling with <0.1% error rate target

### Integration Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 1 Context]
The order reception service provides:
- Entry point for orders into the processing pipeline
- Basic validation before workflow processing begins
- Foundation for the 9-step order processing workflow
- Integration point between Kafka messaging and database storage

### Service Architecture
[Source: PRD Service Architecture]
- **Pattern**: Event-driven microservice with Kafka integration
- **Error Handling**: Dead letter queue integration with retry logic
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and structured logging for observability
- **Tracing**: Correlation ID tracking for distributed system monitoring

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Unit testing with 80%+ coverage for business logic
- Integration testing for Kafka and database operations
- Contract testing for message format validation
- End-to-end testing for complete order reception workflow

#### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `src/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/`
- Contract tests: `tests/contracts/`

#### Testing Frameworks
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Testcontainers for database and Kafka integration testing
- Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing
- Custom utilities for Kafka message testing
