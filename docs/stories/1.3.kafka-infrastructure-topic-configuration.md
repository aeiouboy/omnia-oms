# Story 1.3: Kafka Infrastructure & Topic Configuration

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system architect,  
**I want** to configure Azure Event Hubs and Kafka topic structure,  
**so that** the system supports reliable message-driven order processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Azure Event Hubs configured with proper partition strategy by ShipFromLocationID
2. Core topics created: order.create.v1, order.status.v1, order.validation.v1
3. Dead letter queue (DLQ) topics configured for error handling
4. Schema Registry implemented for message versioning and validation
5. Kafka consumer groups configured for each microservice
6. Message retention policies set (7 days for replay capability)
7. Throughput units configured for 1000 messages/second capacity
8. Kafka client libraries integrated with proper error handling
9. Message serialization/deserialization with JSON schema validation
10. Monitoring dashboards for consumer lag and throughput metrics

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.3 builds on the Azure Event Hubs infrastructure established in Story 1.1 and will provide the messaging backbone for the database operations from Story 1.2.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure]
- **Messaging Platform**: Azure Event Hubs (Kafka-compatible) with premium tier
- **Partition Strategy**: ShipFromLocationID-based partitioning for optimal distribution
- **Message Types**: order.create.v1, order.status.v1, order.validation.v1
- **Retention**: 7 days for replay capability and error recovery

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]
- **Platform**: Azure Event Hubs with Kafka compatibility
- **Client Libraries**: Node.js Kafka client libraries with proper error handling
- **Schema Management**: Schema Registry for message versioning and validation
- **Monitoring**: Grafana integration for consumer lag and throughput monitoring

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Support for 1000+ messages/second throughput capacity
- Message processing with <50ms latency for real-time coordination
- Consumer lag monitoring with threshold-based alerting
- Auto-scaling capabilities for peak load handling

### Integration Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 1 Context]
The Kafka infrastructure provides:
- Event-driven messaging backbone for microservices architecture
- Reliable message delivery with dead letter queue handling
- Regional coordination messaging for multi-store visibility
- Foundation for order processing workflow coordination

### Message Schema Design
[Source: PRD Order Processing Requirements]
- **order.create.v1**: OrderID, ShipFromLocationID, customer data, line items
- **order.status.v1**: OrderID, status updates, timestamp, processing details
- **order.validation.v1**: OrderID, validation results, error details
- **Schema Evolution**: Forward and backward compatibility requirements

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Kafka message processing tests with realistic message volumes
- Consumer lag and throughput performance testing
- Schema validation and message format testing
- Dead letter queue handling and error recovery testing

#### Test File Locations
- Kafka tests: `tests/kafka/`
- Message schema tests: `tests/schemas/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/kafka/`

#### Testing Frameworks
- Kafka testing with testcontainers for integration testing
- Schema validation testing with JSON schema validators
- Load testing for throughput and performance validation
- End-to-end testing with actual Azure Event Hubs
