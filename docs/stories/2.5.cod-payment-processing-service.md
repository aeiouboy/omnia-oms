# Story 2.5: COD Payment Processing Service

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** order processing system,  
**I want** to process cash-on-delivery payments with QC SMF-specific rules,  
**so that** all orders have proper payment status for fulfillment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. COD payment method assignment for all QC SMF orders (payment type validation)
2. Payment status update to 5000 "Paid" (QC SMF exclusive status)
3. Payment processing without complex payment gateway integration
4. COD validation rules specific to QC Small Format requirements
5. Payment audit trail with proper financial tracking (Enhanced: Add Status 5000 "Paid" compliance validation and timing metrics)
6. Payment reversal capability for order cancellations or errors
7. Integration readiness for future PMP delivery confirmation workflow
8. Payment event publishing to order.payment.v1 Kafka topic (Updated: Standardize from generic publishOrderEvent to specific topic)
9. Error handling for payment processing failures with retry logic
10. Payment processing completed within <15ms per order

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.5 follows force allocation (Story 2.4) and implements the fifth step of the 9-step order processing workflow, processing COD payments for allocated QC SMF orders.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 2 - Order Processing Engine]
- **Payment Method**: COD (Cash-On-Delivery) for all QC SMF orders
- **Status Update**: Payment status 5000 "Paid" (QC SMF exclusive)
- **Performance**: <15ms per order payment processing
- **Integration**: PMP delivery confirmation workflow readiness

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Service Architecture]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for payment records and audit trail
- **Messaging**: Kafka event publishing for payment coordination
- **Validation**: COD business rule enforcement for QC SMF
- **Audit**: Comprehensive payment audit trail and financial tracking

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Payment processing within <15ms per order
- Support for 1000+ orders per minute payment capacity
- Payment reversal capability for error recovery
- Integration readiness for future PMP workflows

### COD Payment Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 2 Context]
The COD payment service provides:
- Simplified payment processing without gateway complexity
- QC SMF-specific payment validation and business rules
- Payment status progression to Paid (5000)
- PMP integration readiness for delivery confirmation

### QC SMF Payment Requirements
[Source: PRD Functional Requirements]
- **Payment Method**: COD assignment for all QC SMF orders
- **Status Code**: 5000 "Paid" (exclusive to QC SMF implementation)
- **Validation**: QC Small Format specific payment rules
- **Audit**: Complete payment audit trail for financial compliance

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Unit testing for COD payment logic and validation
