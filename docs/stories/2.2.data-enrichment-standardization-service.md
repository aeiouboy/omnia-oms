# Story 2.2: Data Enrichment & Standardization Service

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** order processing system,  
**I want** to auto-enhance and standardize order data,  
**so that** orders have consistent formatting and complete product information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Auto-enhance blank ShortDescription attributes using product catalog lookup
2. Auto-enhance blank ImageURL attributes with default or catalog images
3. Order ID naming convention standardization according to QC SMF format
4. Product catalog integration for missing product information
5. Line item data normalization and validation
6. Customer information enrichment from available data sources
7. Address standardization and validation for delivery requirements
8. Audit logging of all data enrichment activities for traceability
9. Error handling for failed enrichment with graceful degradation
10. Enrichment processing completed within <30ms per order

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.2 follows the validation service (Story 2.1) and implements the second step of the 9-step order processing workflow, enhancing validated orders with complete product and customer information.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 2 - Order Processing Engine]
- **Enhancement Scope**: Auto-enhancement of ShortDescription, ImageURL, and order formatting
- **Performance**: <30ms per order enrichment processing for workflow efficiency
- **Integration**: Product catalog and customer data source integration
- **Quality**: Comprehensive audit logging for traceability

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Service Architecture]
- **Framework**: Node.js microservice with external API integration
- **Caching**: Redis integration for product catalog and customer data caching
- **APIs**: External product catalog and customer data service integration
- **Logging**: Structured audit logging for enrichment activities

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Enrichment processing within <30ms per order
- Support for 1000+ orders per minute processing capacity
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms

### Data Enrichment Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 2 Context]
The enrichment service provides:
- Automatic product information enhancement from catalogs
- Order data standardization according to QC SMF requirements
- Customer information enrichment from available sources
- Address validation and standardization for delivery accuracy

### External Integration Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]
- **Product Catalog**: Integration for missing product information lookup
- **Customer Data**: Customer profile enhancement from available sources
- **Address Validation**: Delivery address standardization and verification
- **Caching Strategy**: Performance optimization with Redis caching

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Unit testing for enrichment logic with comprehensive coverage
- Integration testing for external API dependencies
- Performance testing to validate <30ms processing target
- Error handling testing for graceful degradation scenarios

#### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `src/enrichment/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/enrichment/`
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/enrichment/`

#### Testing Frameworks
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Nock for API mocking and testing
- Custom utilities for enrichment testing
- Load testing for performance validation
