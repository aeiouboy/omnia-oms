# Story 2.3: Financial Calculation Engine (Cal A-F)

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** order processing system,  
**I want** to perform accurate financial calculations with proper precision,  
**so that** order totals are correct and compliant with QC SMF requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Cal A**: SubTotal calculation - sum of all line item totals with DECIMAL(18,4) precision
2. **Cal B**: TotalCharge calculation - SubTotal + taxes + fees with proper rounding
3. **Cal C**: OrderTotal calculation - final order amount for customer billing
4. **Cal D**: TotalDiscount calculation - applied discounts with validation limits
5. **Cal E**: TotalTaxes calculation - tax calculations based on location and products
6. **Cal F**: Informational Taxes calculation - additional tax information for reporting
7. Financial precision storage as DECIMAL(18,4) with 2-digit display formatting
8. Shipping fee proration exclusion for QC SMF implementation requirements
9. Calculation audit trail for financial reconciliation and debugging
10. All calculations completed within <20ms per order for performance compliance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.3 follows data enrichment (Story 2.2) and implements the third step of the 9-step order processing workflow, performing financial calculations on enriched order data.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 2 - Order Processing Engine]
- **Precision**: DECIMAL(18,4) for all financial calculations with QC SMF compliance
- **Calculations**: Six distinct calculation types (Cal A-F) for comprehensive order totals
- **Performance**: <20ms per order calculation processing for workflow efficiency
- **Audit**: Complete financial audit trail for reconciliation and debugging

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Service Architecture]
- **Precision**: DECIMAL(18,4) storage with proper decimal arithmetic libraries
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with financial precision data types
- **Validation**: Comprehensive financial validation and business rule enforcement
- **Audit**: Structured financial audit logging for compliance

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Financial calculation processing within <20ms per order
- Support for 1000+ orders per minute calculation capacity
- 99%+ data accuracy for financial calculations and audit trails
- Comprehensive error handling for calculation failures

### Financial Calculation Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 2 Context]
The calculation engine provides:
- Comprehensive financial calculations (Cal A-F) for order totals
- QC SMF-specific business rules including shipping fee exclusions
- Financial precision handling with DECIMAL(18,4) storage
- Complete audit trail for financial reconciliation

### QC SMF Financial Requirements
[Source: PRD Functional Requirements]
