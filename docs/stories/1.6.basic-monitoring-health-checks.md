# Story 1.6: Basic Monitoring & Health Checks

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** to establish basic system monitoring and alerting,  
**so that** system health can be tracked and issues identified proactively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Grafana deployed with Azure Monitor integration for infrastructure metrics
2. Application-level health checks implemented for all services
3. Custom dashboards created for order processing metrics
4. Kafka consumer lag monitoring with threshold-based alerting
5. Database performance monitoring with query execution time tracking
6. API response time monitoring with <100ms target validation
7. Error rate monitoring with alerting for >0.1% error threshold
8. Log aggregation configured with Grafana Loki for centralized logging
9. Basic alerting rules configured for critical system metrics
10. Monitoring documentation created for operations team reference

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.6 completes the foundational Epic 1 by adding comprehensive monitoring to all components established in Stories 1.1-1.5.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure]
- **Platform**: Grafana with Azure Monitor for unified monitoring
- **Logging**: Grafana Loki for centralized log aggregation
- **Metrics**: Custom dashboards for order processing and system health
- **Alerting**: Threshold-based alerting with escalation procedures

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]
- **Monitoring**: Grafana for unified monitoring and visualization
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics collection with custom dashboards
- **Logging**: Structured logging with centralized aggregation
- **Integration**: Azure Monitor integration for infrastructure observability

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- API response time monitoring with <100ms target validation
- Error rate monitoring with <0.1% threshold alerting
- Database query performance tracking with optimization alerts
- Real-time monitoring with <10-second refresh rates

### Monitoring Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 1 Context]
The monitoring system provides:
- Comprehensive visibility into system health and performance
- Proactive alerting for performance and error thresholds
- Centralized logging for troubleshooting and analysis
- Foundation for production operations and maintenance

### Observability Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]
- Structured logging with correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Custom metrics for business KPIs and operational metrics
- Alert management with proper escalation and notification
- Dashboard design for different user roles and responsibilities

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Monitoring system testing with metric validation
- Alerting testing with threshold breach simulation
- Dashboard testing with various data scenarios
- Log aggregation testing with structured log validation

#### Test File Locations
