# Story 2.7: Order Workflow Orchestration Service

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system orchestrator,  
**I want** to coordinate the complete 9-step order workflow,  
**so that** orders flow seamlessly through all processing stages with proper error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Sequential workflow execution: Validation → Enrichment → Calculation → Allocation → Payment → Release
2. Workflow state management with proper checkpoint and resume capabilities
3. Error handling at each workflow step with specific error recovery procedures
4. Workflow timeout handling with configurable timeout values per step
5. Workflow audit trail with complete processing history and timing metrics (Enhanced: Add ExpectedPublishOrder.json payload compliance and step-level performance tracking)
6. Dead letter queue integration for failed workflow processing
7. Workflow retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
8. Workflow monitoring and metrics collection for performance analysis
9. Workflow event publishing for downstream system coordination
10. Complete workflow processing within <200ms per order end-to-end (Enhanced: Add step-level timing validation - Validation <50ms, Enrichment <30ms, Calculation <20ms, Allocation <25ms, Payment <15ms, Release <30ms)
