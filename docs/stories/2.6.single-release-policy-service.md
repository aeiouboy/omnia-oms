# Story 2.6: Single Release Policy Service

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** order processing system,  
**I want** to implement single release per order policy,  
**so that** QC SMF operational simplicity requirements are maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Single release creation per order (no partial releases allowed)
2. Release validation ensuring all line items included in single release
3. Order status update to 3000 (Released) upon successful release creation
4. Release event broadcasting to downstream systems via Kafka
5. T1 member attribution integration for POS system requirements
6. Release audit logging with complete release details and timestamps
7. Release reversal capability for failed downstream processing
8. Duplicate release prevention with proper validation and error handling
9. Release event publishing to order.release.v1 topic for fulfillment coordination
10. Release processing completed within <30ms per order

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.6 follows COD payment processing (Story 2.5) and implements the sixth step of the 9-step order processing workflow, creating single releases for paid QC SMF orders.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 2 - Order Processing Engine]
- **Single Release**: One release per order policy for operational simplicity
- **Complete Release**: All line items included in single release
- **Status Update**: Order status 3000 (Released) upon success
- **Performance**: <30ms per order release processing

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Service Architecture]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for release records and audit trail
- **Messaging**: Kafka event publishing for release coordination
- **Validation**: Single release policy enforcement
- **Integration**: T1 member attribution for POS system

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Release processing within <30ms per order
- Support for 1000+ orders per minute release capacity
- Release reversal capability for error recovery
- Duplicate release prevention with validation

### Single Release Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 2 Context]
The single release service provides:
- QC SMF operational simplicity with one release per order
- Complete line item inclusion with validation
- Order status progression to Released (3000)
- Fulfillment coordination via Kafka events

### QC SMF Release Requirements
[Source: PRD Functional Requirements]
- **Single Release**: No partial releases allowed for simplicity
- **Complete Order**: All line items must be included
- **T1 Attribution**: Member association for POS integration
- **Event Coordination**: Release broadcasting for fulfillment

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Unit testing for single release policy enforcement
- Integration testing for release event publishing
- Performance testing to validate <30ms release target
- Error handling testing for duplicate release prevention

#### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `src/release/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/release/`
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/release/`

#### Testing Frameworks
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Custom release testing utilities
- Kafka event testing for release coordination
- Load testing for release performance validation
