# Story 1.2: Database Schema & Core Models

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** backend developer,  
**I want** to implement the core database schema for order management,  
**so that** the system can store and retrieve order data with proper audit trails.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PostgreSQL database schema created with proper indexing strategy
2. Orders table with DECIMAL(18,4) precision for financial fields
3. Order line items table with foreign key relationships
4. Order status history table for audit tracking with UTC timestamps
5. Database migration scripts created for schema versioning
6. Connection pooling configured with PgBouncer for high concurrency
7. Database indexes optimized for order ID and status queries (<10ms response)
8. Proper constraints and triggers for data integrity enforcement
9. Database backup and restore procedures documented and tested
10. Database performance monitoring configured with query analysis

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.2 builds directly on the Azure PostgreSQL infrastructure established in Story 1.1 (Azure Infrastructure Setup).

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: PRD Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer for high concurrency support
- **Precision**: DECIMAL(18,4) for financial calculations with proper monetary handling
- **Performance**: <10ms response times for order ID and status queries

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ for primary transactional database with ACID compliance
- **Migration Tool**: Knex.js or similar migration tool for schema versioning
- **Monitoring**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL monitoring with query performance analysis
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery capabilities

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Non-Functional Requirements]
- Database queries optimized for <10ms response times
- Support for high concurrency with connection pooling
- 99%+ data accuracy for order status tracking
- Support for 1000+ orders per minute processing capacity

### Data Architecture
[Source: PRD Epic 1 Context]
The database schema forms the foundation for:
- Order storage with proper audit trails and status tracking
- Financial calculations with DECIMAL(18,4) precision for QC SMF compliance
- High-performance querying for real-time order status updates
- Integration with Kafka messaging for event-driven architecture

### Security Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Proper access controls and user management
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- Compliance with financial data handling requirements

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: PRD Testing Strategy]
- Database schema validation tests with complete coverage
- Performance testing to validate <10ms query response targets
- Data integrity testing for constraints and business rules
- Migration testing with rollback validation

#### Test File Locations
- Database tests: `tests/database/`
- Migration tests: `database/migrations/tests/`
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/database/`

#### Testing Frameworks
