# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish project foundation with Azure infrastructure, Kafka messaging backbone, and basic order reception pipeline. This epic delivers the foundational technology stack while providing initial order tracking capability, ensuring the system can receive and store orders even before complete workflow implementation.

### Story 1.1: Azure Infrastructure Setup

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** to establish the core Azure infrastructure components,
**so that** the system has reliable, scalable cloud foundation for order processing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Azure Resource Group created with proper naming conventions and tags
2. Azure Database for PostgreSQL 15 deployed with high availability configuration
3. Azure Cache for Redis deployed with clustering enabled
4. Azure Event Hubs namespace created with premium tier for guaranteed throughput
5. Azure Container Registry (ACR) configured with security scanning enabled
6. Azure Application Gateway deployed with SSL termination and WAF protection
7. All resources configured with proper monitoring and alerting via Azure Monitor
8. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates created for reproducible deployments
9. Development, staging, and production environments provisioned
10. Network security groups and private networking configured for service isolation

### Story 1.2: Database Schema & Core Models

**As a** backend developer,
**I want** to implement the core database schema for order management,
**so that** the system can store and retrieve order data with proper audit trails.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. PostgreSQL database schema created with proper indexing strategy
2. Orders table with DECIMAL(18,4) precision for financial fields
3. Order line items table with foreign key relationships
4. Order status history table for audit tracking with UTC timestamps
5. Database migration scripts created for schema versioning
6. Connection pooling configured with PgBouncer for high concurrency
7. Database indexes optimized for order ID and status queries (<10ms response)
8. Proper constraints and triggers for data integrity enforcement
9. Database backup and restore procedures documented and tested
10. Database performance monitoring configured with query analysis

### Story 1.3: Kafka Infrastructure & Topic Configuration

**As a** system architect,
**I want** to configure Azure Event Hubs and Kafka topic structure,
**so that** the system supports reliable message-driven order processing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Azure Event Hubs configured with proper partition strategy by ShipFromLocationID
2. Core topics created: order.create.v1, order.status.v1, order.validation.v1
3. Dead letter queue (DLQ) topics configured for error handling
4. Schema Registry implemented for message versioning and validation
5. Kafka consumer groups configured for each microservice
6. Message retention policies set (7 days for replay capability)
7. Throughput units configured for 1000 messages/second capacity
8. Kafka client libraries integrated with proper error handling
9. Message serialization/deserialization with JSON schema validation
10. Monitoring dashboards for consumer lag and throughput metrics

### Story 1.4: Basic Order Reception Service

**As a** system developer,
**I want** to create a basic order consumer service,
**so that** orders can be received from Kafka and stored in the database.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Node.js microservice created with Fastify framework and TypeScript
2. Kafka consumer implemented for order.create.v1 topic consumption
3. Basic order validation for required fields (OrderID, ShipFromLocationID)
4. Order persistence to PostgreSQL with proper error handling
5. Order status initialized to 1000 (Open) upon successful storage
6. Correlation ID tracking for distributed tracing across services
7. Dead letter queue integration for failed message processing
8. Health check endpoints for container orchestration
9. Structured logging with Winston for centralized log aggregation
10. Unit tests covering order reception and basic validation scenarios

### Story 1.5: Container Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** to establish containerized deployment with automated CI/CD,
**so that** services can be deployed reliably and efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Docker multi-stage builds created for Node.js services with Alpine base images
2. Azure Container Apps configured with auto-scaling policies
3. CI/CD pipeline implemented with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps
4. Automated testing integration in pipeline (unit tests, security scans)
5. Blue-green or rolling deployment strategy implemented
6. Environment-specific configuration management (dev, staging, prod)
7. Container registry integration with vulnerability scanning
8. Service discovery and internal communication configured
9. SSL/TLS certificates automated with Azure Key Vault integration
10. Deployment rollback procedures documented and tested

### Story 1.6: Basic Monitoring & Health Checks

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to establish basic system monitoring and alerting,
**so that** system health can be tracked and issues identified proactively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Grafana deployed with Azure Monitor integration for infrastructure metrics
2. Application-level health checks implemented for all services
3. Custom dashboards created for order processing metrics
4. Kafka consumer lag monitoring with threshold-based alerting
5. Database performance monitoring with query execution time tracking
6. API response time monitoring with <100ms target validation
7. Error rate monitoring with alerting for >0.1% error threshold
8. Log aggregation configured with Grafana Loki for centralized logging
9. Basic alerting rules configured for critical system metrics
10. Monitoring documentation created for operations team reference
