# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

Based on your Project Brief, here are the key desired outcomes the PRD will deliver if successful:

• **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce order processing time by 60% from 5 minutes to <2 minutes per order
• **System Performance**: Achieve <100ms order validation response time (vs. current 2-3 seconds with MAO)
• **Regional Scalability**: Support 50+ QC Small Format stores with single system instance
• **Cost Optimization**: Reduce OMS total cost of ownership by 40% over 3 years
• **Revenue Growth**: Enable 30% increase in daily order volume capacity per store
• **COD Excellence**: Achieve 99%+ COD validation accuracy with automated tracking integration
• **User Empowerment**: Enable self-service bundle promotion setup reducing IT dependency by 90%
• **Training Efficiency**: Reduce new staff training time from 16 hours to <2 hours

### Background Context

Omnia Order Management System addresses the critical complexity overload created by Manhattan Active® Omni (MAO) for Central Food's QC Small Format convenience stores. The current MAO implementation utilizes less than 30% of its 855-page feature set while costing $200K+ annually, creating a 40+ hours/week manual workaround burden for store operations teams processing 80+ daily delivery orders across 25+ neighborhood locations.

This purpose-built, cloud-native OMS will replace MAO's over-engineered omnichannel platform with intelligent defaults for small format retail operations, focusing on native COD payment processing (prevalent in neighborhood deliveries), bundle-aware promotions for convenience store campaigns, and real-time T1 fulfillment center integration. The solution targets a 95% reduction in configuration complexity while maintaining enterprise-grade functionality, supporting QC Small Format's expansion to 50+ stores with modern microservices architecture and Kafka-based regional coordination.
