1. **Cal A**: SubTotal calculation - sum of all line item totals with DECIMAL(18,4) precision
2. **Cal B**: TotalCharge calculation - SubTotal + taxes + fees with proper rounding
3. **Cal C**: OrderTotal calculation - final order amount for customer billing
4. **Cal D**: TotalDiscount calculation - applied discounts with validation limits
5. **Cal E**: TotalTaxes calculation - tax calculations based on location and products
6. **Cal F**: Informational Taxes calculation - additional tax information for reporting
7. Financial precision storage as DECIMAL(18,4) with 2-digit display formatting
8. Shipping fee proration exclusion for QC SMF implementation requirements
9. Calculation audit trail for financial reconciliation and debugging
10. All calculations completed within <20ms per order for performance compliance

### Story 2.4: Force Allocation Service

**As a** order processing system,
**I want** to perform force allocation bypassing stock validation,
**so that** QC SMF orders are immediately allocated for fulfillment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Stock validation bypass implementation (IsForceAllocation=True enforcement)
2. Inventory allocation from specified ShipFromLocationID for all line items
3. Order status update to 2000 (Allocated) upon successful allocation
4. Allocation audit logging with timestamp and location tracking
5. Line item allocation tracking with individual allocation records
6. Error handling for allocation failures with proper error messaging
7. Allocation reversal capability for failed downstream processing
8. Multi-location allocation support for line items from different locations
9. Allocation event publishing to order.status.v1 Kafka topic for coordination
10. Force allocation processing completed within <25ms per order

### Story 2.5: COD Payment Processing Service

**As a** order processing system,
**I want** to process cash-on-delivery payments with QC SMF-specific rules,
**so that** all orders have proper payment status for fulfillment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. COD payment method assignment for all QC SMF orders (payment type validation)
2. Payment status update to 5000 "Paid" (QC SMF exclusive status)
3. Payment processing without complex payment gateway integration
4. COD validation rules specific to QC Small Format requirements
5. Payment audit trail with proper financial tracking
6. Payment reversal capability for order cancellations or errors
7. Integration readiness for future PMP delivery confirmation workflow
8. Payment event publishing to order.payment.v1 Kafka topic
9. Error handling for payment processing failures with retry logic
10. Payment processing completed within <15ms per order

### Story 2.6: Single Release Policy Service

**As a** order processing system,
**I want** to implement single release per order policy,
**so that** QC SMF operational simplicity requirements are maintained.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Single release creation per order (no partial releases allowed)
2. Release validation ensuring all line items included in single release
3. Order status update to 3000 (Released) upon successful release creation
4. Release event broadcasting to downstream systems via Kafka
5. T1 member attribution integration for POS system requirements
6. Release audit logging with complete release details and timestamps
7. Release reversal capability for failed downstream processing
8. Duplicate release prevention with proper validation and error handling
9. Release event publishing to order.release.v1 topic for fulfillment coordination
10. Release processing completed within <30ms per order

### Story 2.7: Order Workflow Orchestration Service

**As a** system orchestrator,
**I want** to coordinate the complete 9-step order workflow,
**so that** orders flow seamlessly through all processing stages with proper error handling.
