# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create an intuitive, efficiency-focused interface that reduces cognitive load for store operations teams processing 80-120+ orders during peak periods. The UI should feel familiar to retail staff with limited technical background, emphasizing visual status indicators, one-click actions, and real-time feedback. Design philosophy centers on "operational simplicity" - each screen should support rapid task completion with minimal training overhead, transitioning users from the current 16-hour MAO training requirement to <2 hours for full proficiency.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Dashboard-Centric Navigation**: Single-page application with persistent navigation sidebar and real-time order status dashboard as the primary workspace. Orders flow through clear visual pipelines (Received → Validated → Released → Fulfilled) with color-coded status indicators.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Complex order details available through expandable cards and modal overlays, keeping primary interface clean while providing drill-down access to full order information, bundle components, and COD payment tracking.

**Batch Operations**: Multi-select capabilities for bulk order processing, bundle creation, and status updates to support high-volume operations during peak periods.

**Mobile-First Responsive**: Optimized for store tablets with touch-friendly controls, appropriate sizing for 10-12" screens, and offline-capable order status viewing.

## Core Screens and Views

**Main Order Dashboard**: Real-time order pipeline view with drag-and-drop status updates, bulk selection, search/filter capabilities, and regional store coordination panel

**Order Detail & Validation**: Comprehensive order information with COD payment validation, bundle component breakdown, customer profile display, and T1 fulfillment center allocation interface

**Bundle Management Interface**: Self-service bundle creation and promotion setup with drag-and-drop component selection, pricing calculator, and seasonal campaign scheduling

**Regional Coordination View**: Multi-store order visibility with real-time status updates, inventory allocation insights, and store-to-store coordination messaging

**COD Collection Tracking**: Payment validation dashboard with delivery status integration, collection confirmation workflow, and daily reconciliation summary

**System Monitoring & Health**: Simple system status display with Kafka message processing health, API response time indicators, and error notification center

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ensuring usability across diverse store staff capabilities, with particular focus on:
- High contrast color schemes for various lighting conditions in store environments
- Keyboard navigation support for efficiency-focused users
- Screen reader compatibility for inclusive operations
- Touch target sizing appropriate for tablet use with potential glove use

## Branding

Clean, professional interface aligned with Central Food's corporate identity while maintaining operational focus. Color palette should support rapid visual status identification (green=completed, orange=pending, red=error) without compromising brand consistency. Typography optimized for quick scanning and number/ID recognition critical in order processing workflows.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary Platform**: Web responsive application optimized for store tablets (10-12" screens) with Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+ support

**Secondary Support**: Desktop browser access for regional coordinators and management reporting

**Progressive Web App**: Offline capability for basic order status viewing during connectivity issues

**Future Consideration**: Native mobile app for Phase 2 expansion based on user feedback
