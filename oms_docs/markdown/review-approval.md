The review process allows users to verify the items and quantities before they approve the order. Once the review is complete and the user is satisfied, the order can be &#39;Release in Progress&#39; status. After approval, the order and its related order lines (items) are created. Process Flow Initiate Review&nbsp;is an explicit user action, performed at order level or order group level. Users can initiate and review, by explicitly performing start review action in the UI, or by performing other actions like (build to bracket, build with extra days, recalculate actions etc.) will set the order status to review in progress. Review timestamp will be updated for the order, if the user starts the review at order level(Sourcing Relationship level), similarly it will be updated for all the orders under the order group if the user starts review at order group level. Users cannot approve the orders without starting the review. Once the user initiates the review at either the order or order group level, they can perform various actions at the order or order group level before ultimately approving the order. Whenever the user is reviewing the order, any change in the supply (OnHand/OnOrder) and forecast change will not affect the order; it only updates the latest suggested order quantity on the IM. Once the Order is &#39;Release in Progress&#39;, the order status will be updated back to the suggested status, and the corresponding order and order lines will be generated for the order. Once the Order is &#39;Release in Progress&#39;,&nbsp;balanced totals, extra days, order due, order category, review timestamp, applied bracketId will be set to null and final totals, required totals will be set to zero at order level (invento&#39;ryMovementSummary level). Similarly, final order quantity, balanced quantity, latest suggested order qty, suggested qty, final order days, balanced order days will be set to zero and issoqcleared, &nbsp;exceptionclear boolean flags are set to false at the order line (inventory movement level).
