Order Total High Order Total Low Line Exceptions: Line exceptions, on the other hand, apply to specific lines or items within an order.

(Refer How to link Sourcing Relationship) Once the exception policy is configured, the same has to be linked with the sourcing relationship.&nbsp; Each sourcing relationship can have a different policy. Example In the below example, Order Policy 1 is set up for Vendor1&rarr;DC1 Order Policy 2&nbsp;is set up for Vendor2&rarr;DC1 Order Policy 3&nbsp;is set up for Vendor3&rarr;DC1 Vendor1 might be a regular vendor and the buyer wants&nbsp;to see an exception only if the order quantity goes above 1000 units. Vendor2&nbsp;might be the second choice and the buyer wants to be alerted when the Order level crosses 500 units Vendor3&nbsp;might be the last&nbsp;choice and the buyer wants to be alerted when the Order level crosses 100&nbsp;units Vendor DC Order Exception Policy Exception Type Threshold Vendor1 DC1 Order Policy 1 Order Total High 1000 Vendor2 DC1 Order Policy 2 Order Total High 500 Vendor3 DC1 Order Policy 3 Order Total High 100 Evaluate Order Exceptions Once the Exception Policy is created and is linked to the Sourcing Relationship, each time an order is calculated, the system evaluates if there are any&nbsp;exceptions at the Sourcing Relationship Level. The system looks for exceptions in the below scenarios:- Order Build SOQ Computation/Recalculate Example&nbsp; Exceptions will be generated if the set threshold is crossed. There are also exception types which do not require a threshold, which means there will be an exception on the order even if there isn&#39;t a threshold value. &nbsp; Vendor DC Item Order Exception Policy Exception Type Threshold Extra Days SOQ Exceptions Vendor1&nbsp; DC1 &nbsp; Order Policy 1 Order Total High 1000 &nbsp; 1210 Yes (Header Exception) Vendor1 DC1 Item1 Order Policy 1 Line Total High 500 &nbsp; 750 Yes (Line Level Exception) Vendor1 DC1 Item2 Order Policy 1 Line Total High 300 &nbsp; 380 Yes (Line Level Exception) Vendor1 DC1 Item3 Order Policy 1 Line Total Low 100 &nbsp; 80 Yes (Line Level Exception) Vendor2 DC1 &nbsp; Order Policy 2 Order Total Low 500 &nbsp; 380 Yes (Header Exception) Vendor2 DC1 Item1 Order Policy 2 Extra Days 2 5 280 Yes (Line Level Exception) Vendor2 DC1 Item1 Order Policy 2 Insufficient SOQ &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 Yes (Line Level Exception) &nbsp; In the above example,&nbsp; Order Level Exceptions These exceptions apply to the entire order. &nbsp; Vendor1&rarr;DC1 - Order Total High - 1 (The SOQ for Vendor1&rarr;DC1 relationship is 1210 units, and the threshold is 1000 units. Hence, we see an Order Total High Exception at the order level) Vendor1&rarr;DC1 - Order Total Low - 1 (The SOQ for Vendor2&rarr;DC1 relationship is 400&nbsp;units, and the threshold is 500&nbsp;units. Hence, we see an Order Total Low&nbsp;Exception at the order level) Order Line Level Exceptions Line exceptions, on the other hand, apply to specific lines or items within an order. Vendor1&rarr;DC1&nbsp;- Line Total&nbsp;High-2 (Item1,Item2),&nbsp;Line Total Low-1 (Item3) Vendor2&rarr;DC1&nbsp;- Extra Days 1(Item1), Insufficient SOQ-1 (Item1) Review/Clear Exceptions (Refer&nbsp;Clear Exceptions) Exceptions, if any, will be displayed on the Suggested Orders UI. This gives a chance for the users to view the exceptions and take appropriate actions. Users can&nbsp;clear exceptions by the below methods:- Clear Exceptions (without any corrections) Review Exceptions and adjust the exception values Approve the Order (Automatically clears exceptions) Configuration How to set up Order Exception Policy Admins can&nbsp;configure the Exception Policy can be configured on the UI(Order Exception Policy from Menu)&nbsp;and using the API.
