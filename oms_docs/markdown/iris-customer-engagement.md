These tools facilitate seamless and personalized interactions between store associates and customers by leveraging configurable options tailored to customer needs. Upon accessing Customer Engagement, users are provided with a comprehensive overview of the customer, enabling them to deliver personalized and efficient service. Feature Summary Customer Insights: access customer notes, view customer purchase metrics, view last transaction, view previously purchased items Activity: create appointments, view announcements and tasks View Profile: gives user detailed view of customer information Customer Notes: allows user to add and edit notes along with filtering and sorting Interactions: view and respond to the latest customer interactions: e-mails, text messages, phone logs Wishlist: allows user to view customers’ saved wanted (wish-list) items and take action against them: add to cart, ship to address, pickup in store Lookbook: user can view, edit and add to their lookbook pages All functionalities listed are configureable and can be restricted to specific roles via user grants All Customer Engagement features are available in POS Classic. Navigation has been added to allow users to access this functionality through the current POS via the new customer profile and customer insights screens. POS Navigation to Customer Engagement via Customer Profile and Customer Insights Page When a customer search begins and the desired customer is selected, the user can either attach or view the customer. This action takes them to the corresponding page(s) where a new raindrop component is displayed. When the user selects ‘Attach’ customer, they will be brought to the Customer Insights page where there will be a raindrop to the right of the view profile link which will navigate them to Customer Engagement. When the user selects ‘View’ customer, they will be brought to the Customer Profile page where there will be a raindrop on the top right of the profile page which will navigate them to Customer Engagement. A back arrow now appears on the top left of each Customer Engagement functionality which redirects the user back to POS. Upon landing back into Iris, the last viewed or attached customer and item(s) in the cart should also be retained. Navigation to Customer Engagement via Home and Hamburger Menus Users can access full Classic Customer Engagement functionality from Home in Omni Facade Under the Engagement sub-header there will be a list of accessible Customer Engagement options (configured by user grants). Users can access full Classic Customer Engagement functionality by clicking any of the options from the Hamburger Menu. The same options will appear if the user selects the Hamburger Menu (configured by user grants) Customer Insights The customer insight page is available once the user attaches the customer to a new order. The insights page allows the user a quick view into the customer's sale metrics as well as previously purchased items. Pinned Notes: If there are any pinned customer notes the user can access them from the header section View Profile: Users can navigate to the customer profile to make changes or add/delete shipping addresses Note: Due to space constraints, devices with a small form factor (e.g., iPhones) display Profile and Feed as tabs, with Feed selected by default. On larger form factor devices (e.g., iPads), both Profile and Feed are shown side by side on the same page, with the Feed tab still marked as selected. Raindrop Menu: Users can tap on this to navigate to classic Customer Engagement: activity, notes, appointments, lookbooks, etc. The only interactive section on the screen other than the ones listed above is the Last Transaction. When tapped, the user will be navigated to the order details screen. Order Details Users can access additional details about a customer's most recent order by tapping the last transaction container on the Customer insight page. The additional details displayed are : Item fulfillment status: In Progress, Picked, Packed, Fulfilled, Returned, Back Ordered are some examples. Item shipment status: Open, In Progress or Completed ETA for ship to address orders. If the carrier does not have this available, then ETA is the earliest allocation date for the order. Payment Methods For any tender that is authorized but not yet settled, there will be an indication stating "authorized". All other tenders will be settled. Activity Appointments Within the application, users can create appointments with the customer. Use cases driving this are: a) Outbound Marketing: Store associates get involved in preparing the schedule to call up customers to explain the newly added items, items got back in stock which the customer wished to buy and so on. b) If the customer is visiting the store to check out items personally, the store associate can fix the appointment to provide personalized assistance. Users can edit the appointment to update the date /time or the purpose. Once the appointment is complete, the same can be reflected in the system against the relevant record by setting the status to "Completed". The Appointment screen under Customer Activity has two available views: calendar and list. The list view displays key information like date, time, and current status. Users can sort this list by "created date" and "time". Users can also filter the appointment by their completion status. The Calendar view gives a view of appointments for the current month. Users can select a date with an appointment and navigate to view, edit or delete the appointment, or a user can select a date without an appointment and create one. Users can choose to switch between the two views from a drop down menu selection. Note: If Calendar duration is enabled, then the user needs to enter only the start time of the appointment or task, and set the duration. The end time is automatically calculated for the user. Tasks Tasks can be created within customer engagement by associating the customer to cater to some of the specific requirements, such as, a customer is expected at the store and the associate wants to keep things ready to serve the customer. To ensure this happens and for tracking purposes, tasks are created. Like appointments, tasks can be modified to change the time or the purpose. Once the task is complete, the same can be updated in the system by marking it "Completed". The Tasks screen within Customer Activity lists the tasks created for the customer along with their current status. Users can filter tasks by status and sort by date too. Additionally, tasks also have a calendar and a list view that behaves in an identical way to the appointments. Phone Log Typically, store associates log their telephonic correspondence with the customer, which is referred to as a Phone Log. This can be used for auditing and reporting purposes. A Phone log can be created prior to the actual call, if it is planned in advance, or after completion. A phone log, similar to task and appointment, can be scheduled. This is created if the store associate is planning a telephonic call for marketing purposes, informing about new arrivals and so on. Users can edit the phone log to change the time or purpose. Users can sort the list based on the status and created date time. Email Log A store associate, who invests time with the customer explaining item features, may wish to email the details so that the customer can refer to them even after exiting the store. This enhances the customer experience and sales potential. Thus, Email logs are the records of email communication with the customer. Most often it consists of item details and images. If the customer is activated, the registered email ID is selected automatically for emailing purposes. Users can add more to the list too. For the purpose of sending emails, users have to create the email templates under Masterdatafacade>>Clienteling Configurations>>Email Templates. Example: New Arrival, Back In stock Notification, Birthday Wishes and so on. Templates thus created get listed on the New Email screen. The user needs to select one of them to load the predefined template. Notes Notes, created with the customer associated, are brief notes created to keep track of the customer's preferences, additional information that helps in better service. An associate can create Notes as Public or Private ones. Public Notes can be accessed by all users who have permission to do so, whereas Private Notes can be accessed only by the user who has created them. Users can create, edit, delete, filter and sort notes from the Notes screen. Note: Prior to Release 25.3, customer notes data was saved to the clienteling>note entity.  Going forward, notes will be saved to customer>note entity, ensuring consistency with those retailers who use both POS and CS products to capture notes.  This feature is controlled by Behavior Change timer, "POS - Combine Customer Notes with CS". It will be released in production environments on August 15, 2026, but you can opt-in earlier. Wishlist Customer engagement within Active Omni provides the ability to get the consolidated  wishlist of the customer, across all channels. An item can be added to the active customer's wishlist from Item Details screen. Item from the wishlist can be moved to Cart if the customer decides to buy them. When navigating to Wishlist from POS: Once the user has been redirected from POS to Customer Engagement using the Wishlist functionality, when they click on any items in the Wishlist, they will be navigated to the items details page. If the user presses the back arrow on the Wishlist items details page, the user will navigate to the customer profile (view) or insights (attach) page. Workspace (Classic POS Only) Workspace provides the scratch pad functionality where one or more items can be added from the different categories. Workspace now provides the ability to share the item details over email or text. Retailers can share single or multiple items with the customer over email. These item details are sent over the email as embedded images with additional item details. Retailers can add as many items as they want and share over email. These items are shared using specific templates which are configurable. The email triggered from Workspace creates an interaction record. Loyalty (Classic POS Only) Customer Loyalty exhibits the consolidated view of business done by the customer, with the retailer's brand, across sales channels. It provides the purchases and return value for the current and previous calendar year. It is read-only data. Loyalty Status Retailer can assign loyalty status to each customer, based on their own internal criteria such as past purchase, value of items purchase/returns by customer and so on, or, can use any 3rd party application to determine the status. For example, customers could be assigned Bronze, Silver, Platinum. In addition, each status can be associated to a graphic indicator "emoji", in addition to the status text. This emoji is displayed at various cart screens next to the customer name to help the store associates to understand the customer and serve them better. User can choose to associate the emoji images to status descriptions via the statusImageUrl field in customerStatus service via script. If the retailer does not wish to use this feature, they should not associate Loyalty Status to any image. This is not a required association. Interactions Interactions between a retailer and a customer are no longer restricted to an in store purchase. More and more retailers are using various communication methods to interact with their customers for various reasons. The Interactions tab in the customer record provides store personnel the ability to view these various communications between the retailer and the customer, as well as initiate communications. From the Store application, user may generate outbound Emails from a variety of screens and Text Messages from the Interaction screens.   These Emails and Text messages are always generated on behalf of the Location (Store), via a storewide email address or text from a common store "phone number".   They are not personalized to the associate. Interactions of different types can be made available/unavailable based on configurations, as well as user resourceIDs and grants. Outbound: Email and Text interactions are created from various locations within the application: Global Add, Interactions Menu, Workspace, Activity, and Item details. User can add attachments to both Emails and Text Messages.  These are currently limited to item images and descriptions.   In order to attach, the items must be present in the Workspace. Inbound: If a text or email interaction is Inbound to the store, as could occur for example if a recipient replies to an outbound Email or Text, Store application will link the sender's information to a customerID record whenever possible.   If this is successful, the interaction is displayed on that customer's Interaction tab.  Otherwise the inbound interaction is considered an 'anonymous' communication and is not available in any customer view. Note: Customer interactions will show all interactions for the customer, regardless of the location with which the customer has interacted.  Example: Store 001 will see interactions that Customer A had with Store 001, Store 002 as well as Contact Center, and so on. Opt-In/Out With increasing communication regulations, customers will have the ability to choose whether or not they would like to opt-in or out of receiving different communications. Based on this selection, the application will either allow, or prevent, a user from sending communications to a customer. Note: The Opt-in/out selection will only be used for on-demand communications such as email and text.  This selection will not affect emailed receipts or order status updates.  No automated message is sent as a result of changing a customer's Optin preferences - for example, "Type STOP to unsubscribe". Profile Stores are evolving to be more customer-centric facilities. This is the channel where customers; actual or potential, make their visit to purchase items. Customers may also physically visit the store for other services, such as return the items purchased across channels, change of address, contact details and so on. Hence, it is important that the store associate have the ability to add new customer data, modify existing ones, and view the current data to provide better service. Within the store application, user can add customers, modify current details, and search. While adding or editing the customer, retailer can choose to verify the address provided by the customer. This is driven by configuration under POSServices>>commonConfig>>isAddressVerificationRequired. As part of customer creation, Billing and Shipping addresses are captured. For the purpose of re-use and convenience user can select one of the addresses as default, which would be used during order creation and can be overridden, if required. Customers walking into the store may wish to change their contact number or address, in which case the store associate can pull up the current details through search to update the required information. Note: The customer profile can be accessed through both POS > Customer Insights and the Customer Engagement space. Note: For phone number formatting in customer profile, the formatting applies only to phone number inputs; text fields do not support formatting. Active Customer Drop-down (Classic POS Only) When a customer is made active in POS, the user has the ability to tap the customer name in the sub-header to navigate to the various tabs within the customer record. With customer engagement, the user will now be able to not only navigate to the customer record tabs, but will also view the customer sub-header and customer dashboard information based on the configurations enabled by the retailer. Waiting Room (Classic POS Only) Waiting Room within POS application indicates the list of customers who is not actively interacting with the store associate currently.  The two most common scenarios in which the customer is placed in waiting room are: Store associate prepares the list of item for an appointment with a customer, activates the customer and add one or more items to the workspace and place this customer into a waiting room. During the appointment, this customer is retrieved from the waiting room, thus restoring all workspace items. This way, store associate can effectively utilize customer's time while in store. Store associate working with a customer, some items in workspace, some in the cart. Customer leaves the transaction in the middle to check out some more items or to a fitting room. In such scenario, workspace items and the transaction in progress is placed in waiting room to be retrieved later. Store associate can work with another customer in the meanwhile. Waiting Room records are associated with particular store associated, who is the employee of the organization and can be locked or unlocked. If locked, only the original associate can retrieve this customer from waiting room. If the waiting room in not locked, then any user can retrieve. In progress order that is placed in waiting room is put on hold. When retrieved, the hold is resolved and new order ID is created. Details of the current order gets copied to the new order. Deleting record from waiting room: If the user has "ui::clienteling::note::deletenote" ui grant, then the user will have an option to see delete icon. User can select waiting room record created by him/her and delete the records. User cannot delete waiting room record created by other users. The menu count on the waiting room does not have polling, i.e. Menu count is not refreshed unless clicked. User need to click atleast once to poll the records and the menu count is appear for that session. Lookbook More and more, retailers are working to create an enhanced experience when a customer shops with them. This leaves the customer with a strong feeling of value, therefore increasing the likelihood that they will not only continue to shop with the retailer, but will also recommend them to friends and family. Part of this experience involves engaging with the customers by creating lookbooks. A lookbook is part of a customizable shopping experience. These lookbooks combine items that the customer has already purchased from the retailer, and combines them with new items to make a tailor-made look for the customer. Customers can use these lookbooks to find favorite items, discover new items, and get inspired. The key benefits to marketing with lookbooks is that they fire up human sense, which is an important driver behind buying decisions. Some common use cases of lookbook are listed below: High end retailers or personal shoppers can use lookbooks to send new and updated looks to their customers prior to them entering the store. This can help the customer determine what items they may want to look at in more detail when they visit the store, saving them time and money. Retailers can provide different combinations of items to appeal to customers with different style preferences. This allows the retailer to get creative and display their products in new ways. A well-photographed and well-marketed lookbooks can inspire shoppers to buy. Lookbook global configuration and grants There is a global configuration to enable lookbook feature on POS application. Users can access this configuration from the Config UI under "Manage POS Configuration" > "Lookbook Configuration". To enable lookbook, update "Display Lookbook" to true.
