Inventory Optimization might use the Review Cycle days value to calculate the SOQ. &nbsp; Process Flow &nbsp; Review Schedule Policy:&nbsp; The purpose of setting up a review schedule policy is to compute the review cycle days. Verify if review days are configured in the sourcing relationship. If configured, compute the last review date and the next review date for the sourcing relationship. Refer to Review Days on how to set up. If not configured, the review cycle will be fetched from Global settings. Example - Review Schedule Fetch the Day of the week on which Last Review Date happened for the Relationship (E.g. 16 Jul 2024&nbsp;- Falls on Sunday) Fetch the Review Frequency and Type (E.g. 2 DAY) Compute the Next Review Date = Last Review Date + Frequency Days ( 18 Jul 2024&nbsp;- Falls on Tuesday) Check if the Next Review Day is configured for Review Days (E.g. Check if Tuesday is a valid review day). if Yes, proceed to next step If No, Find the next Review day (E.g: Thursday is a valid review day). Compute Review Cycle as difference between Next Review Day - Last Review Day (From this example. It is 4 days) Review Days: Review days are the days on which an order can be placed The days when an order cannot be placed are not considered a valid Review day. Example - Review DaysUsers can set up the Review days considering the below factors:-&nbsp; In some cases, it is possible to order each day; in other cases, orders are placed on a schedule (for example, every 7 days or 14 days). Some suppliers will only let vendors&nbsp;order on specific days of the week. Other suppliers will only let vendors order after a specific number of days have passed since the last&nbsp;last order. &nbsp; Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday &nbsp; Yes &nbsp; Yes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the above example, If today is Thursday, the Review Cycle days value is 4, because there are four days between the current day and the next valid review day(Monday). If today is Monday, the Review Cycle days value is 2, as there are two days between Monday & Wednesday. &nbsp; A valid order Review day is any day when an order can be placed. &nbsp;In the below case we see Monday through Thursday are valid review days. Saturday and Sunday are the only non-review days. This means orders can be placed only Monday through Friday and no orders can be placed on Saturday & Sunday. &nbsp; Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday &nbsp; Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes &nbsp; &nbsp; Configuration &nbsp; Review cycle can be configured in the Sourcing Relationship.&nbsp; &nbsp; {{url}}/itemlocation/api/itemlocation/sourcingRelationship/save { &quot;SourceLocationId&quot;: &quot;{{DCLocId1}}&quot;, &quot;LocationId&quot;: &quot;{{StoreLocId1}}&quot;, &quot;DefaultTransitTime&quot;: &quot;7.0&quot;, &quot;OrderCycle&quot;: &quot;7&quot;, &quot;RelationType&quot;: { &quot;RelationTypeId&quot;: &quot;Regular&quot; }, &quot;ReviewFrequencyValue&quot;: 1, &quot;ReviewFrequencyType&quot;: &quot;DAY&quot;, &quot;IsSundayReview&quot;: true, &quot;IsMondayReview&quot;: true, &quot;IsTuesdayReview&quot;: true, &quot;IsWednesdayReview&quot;: true, &quot;IsThursdayReview&quot;: true, &quot;IsFridayReview&quot;: true, &quot;IsSaturdayReview&quot;: true, } &nbsp; &nbsp; Implementation Flavors NA UIs and Entities NA &nbsp; Services The&nbsp;APIs listed in the following table are referenced in this document.
