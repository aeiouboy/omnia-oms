As the order quantity increases, the buyer can unlock better discounts, making it financially advantageous to purchase in larger volumes. This strategy encourages bulk buying by offering progressively lower prices as the order size rises, allowing buyers to assess whether it&#39;s more cost-effective to increase their order to take advantage of these volume-based price reductions. Break point pricing benefits businesses by lowering per-unit costs, improving profit margins, and optimizing inventory. SCP uses several factors to determine the optimal order quantity (SOQ) and whether to take advantage of a volume-based discount at a specific breakpoint. Key factors include: Raw Order Quantity (ROQ) &ndash; This is the amount of inventory to order before considering other variables, like minimum purchase quantities or planned demand. Carrying Cost Percentage &ndash; The cost of holding inventory over the long term; higher carrying costs discourage ordering large quantities, especially if it doesn&rsquo;t justify a discount. Line Cost &ndash; The cost to order, receive, and manage one line item; higher line costs may incentivize ordering larger quantities to reduce frequent ordering costs. Purchase cost and Discount &ndash; The savings achieved by reaching a breakpoint, which influences the decision to order larger quantities. Using these factors, a jump point is determined, which represents the threshold at which it&rsquo;s financially beneficial to order more inventory to move to a lower price point at the next breakpoint. The jump point is the quantity at which the combined costs (carrying, line, and purchase cost) are minimized. Finally, the adjusted ROQ is compared to the jump point within the appropriate breakpoint level. If the ROQ is at or exceeds the jump point, the order quantity is rounded up to the next breakpoint. If the ROQ falls between a breakpoint and a jump point, no adjustment is made, and the original ROQ is maintained. This process helps optimize inventory costs while ensuring the best financial decision is made. When configuring the break point, it provides&nbsp;you with the following discount types: Percent Discount - Overall discount expressed as a percentage. Price Override - New price to use if this break point is selected. Discount Amount per UOM - Overall discount expressed as a currency value for some unit of measure. Each source&nbsp;can offer up to six breakpoint prices&nbsp;for each SKU, allowing for multiple price tiers at different volume levels. This flexibility helps optimize purchasing decisions by aligning the most cost-effective pricing structure with your inventory needs. &nbsp; For example: Assume a purchase cost of $20.00, and a buying multiple of 1. &nbsp; Break Point Breakpoint Minimum Purchase Qty Calculated Jump Point Discount (Assume price override) 1 500 651 19.80 2 1000 1117 19.50 3 1500 1674 19.25 4 2000 &nbsp; 19.00 &nbsp; So, in this example, the resulting SOQ would work out like this: &nbsp; If the Adjusted ROQ (Today&rsquo;s raw need) is this: &hellip; then the final SOQ will be this: Comments 250 250 No advantage for jumping; today&rsquo;s need is below the first breakpoint. 531 531 Today&rsquo;s need is already within breakpoint 1, but is not above jump point for jumping to breakpoint 2. 683 1000 Today&rsquo;s need is above the jump point, so the SOQ is based on achieving the minimum for breakpoint 2. 1600 1600 Today&rsquo;s need is already within breakpoint 3, but is not above jump point for jumping to breakpoint 4. 1811 2000 Today&rsquo;s need is above the jump point, so the SOQ is based on achieving the minimum for breakpoint 4. &nbsp; Examples: Example 1 Break Point #1 = 200 (offering a 3% discount); Jump Point = 1 Break Point #2 = 500 (offering a 4% discount); Jump Point = 347 ROQ = 244 SOQ = 244 (the ROQ is higher than the first break point quantity, but not the jump point for the next highest break point) &nbsp; Example 2 Break Point #1 = 200 (offering a 3% discount); Jump Point = 1 Break Point #2 = 500 (offering a 4% discount); Jump Point = 347 ROQ = 389 SOQ = 500 (the ROQ is higher than the next jump point and less than the next highest break point quantity) &nbsp; Configurations Breakpoint configuration is done as part of itemLocationSource configuration.
