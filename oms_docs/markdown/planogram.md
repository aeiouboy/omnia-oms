The planogram configurations are typically interfaced from host systems when a new planogram is added for set of Items or replaced with new set of Items. The new planograms are typically defined for the below use case Change the assortment periodically based on seasonal demand of Item Add additional shelves E.g. Add an end cap for essential products or most sold products for easy accessibility across locations The planogram configurations are defined at Item Location and has two main purposes Order additional quantity for new assortments - Minimum Display (Minimum quantity) and Maximum Space (Maximum constraint) for Order quantity (enabled by default) Enforce Life Cycle Policy change based on the Activation and Deactivationdates which can enabled or disabled through configurations Process Flow The process begins with the configuration of the Planogram through a user interface (UI) or an integration. This step ensures that the appropriate item locations and planogram settings are defined before proceeding further. Once the Planogram is configured, the system fetches active planograms for SOQ computation. The Planograms that have Activation Date <= Current business date and Deactivation Date > Current business date are considered Active. SOQ Calculation The Replenishment engine will consider all active planograms on the day of SOQ calculation and determine SOQ based on their configurations. It will use the Minimum Display and Maximum Space values defined in the active planograms for SOQ calculation. Example: Consider the below configuration of a Planogram defined for an Item Location PlanogramId Activation Date Deactivation Date Minimum Display Maximum Space Planogram1 Oct-01 Oct-30 5 Planogram2 Oct-10 Nov-30 10 250 Planogram3 Oct-11 Dec-30 20 100 SOQ calculation on different business dates: Current Business Date Initial SOQ (without Planogram) Explanation Oct-01 300 Planogram1 is Active and Minimum Display value of 5 should be considered for SOQ calculation. Oct-10 300 Planogram1 and Planogram2 are Active Planogram2 has Maximum Space = 250 which is lesser than the Initial SOQ. The Planogram Maximum Space should be honored and the final SOQ computed should not be greater than 250 Oct-31 300 Planogram2 and Planogram3 are Active. Minimum values of both planograms should be considered for SOQ calculation as Inital SOQ + Sum (Minimum Display) would not exceed the sum(Maximum Space) for both planograms Life Cycle Policy If a Planogram has Change Life Cycle Status = True,  then Replenishment will change life cycle codes based on the Activation and Deactivation Dates of the Planogram and the Life Cycle Code on Activation and Life Cycle Code on Deactivation defined at Item or Item Inheritance policies. Example: Consider a Planogram with the below configurations for an Item Location. MS1 - Change Life Cycle = True Current Life Cycle Policy for the Item = Active Life Cycle Code when Activated = Temporary Life Cycle Code when Deactivated = Discontinued PlanogramId Activation Date Deactivation Date Minimum Display Planogram1 Oct-01 Oct-30 5 SOQ calculation on different dates: Current Business Date LCP Code Sep-30 Active Oct-01 Temporary Oct-30 Discontinued Configurations Planogram configurations The configurations are defined at Item Location UI (Item Location -> Planogram). Attributes Description / Possible values Planogram Id Unique Planorgram Id Descriptoin Description of the Planogram Change Life Cycle True - Enforce Life cycle policy change when the Planogram is effective based on the codes defined in Life Cycle Code on Activation and Life Cycle Code on Deactivation in Item or Item Inheritance policy False - Do not enforce Life Cycle Policy change Activation Date Date from which the Planogram is active Deactivation Date Date on which the Planogram becomes inactive Minimum Display Minimum incremental quantity for Order calculation Maximum Space Maximum constraint on order quality for the Item Location Item and Item Inheritance configurations The below parameters are defined at both Item and Item Inheritance policies and will honor inheritance precedence. Attributes Description Life Cycle Code on Activation The life cycle code that should be considered on Activation date when "Change Life Cycle" value is True for Planogram Life Cycle Code on Deactivation The life cycle code that should be considered on Deactivation date when "Change Life Cycle" value is True for Planogram Replenishment Parameter Configuration The following parameters describe the configuration of Replenishment settings. Attributes Description Buffer days The number of calendar days that can exist between the deactivation of one Planogram and the activation of another Planogram. If the difference in deactivation/activation days is less than the buffer, Replenishment will ignore the life cycle policy change and ignore the Planogram sell-down logic. Ensure Receipt by Activation Date The parameter ensures that the required inventory as defined in Planogram configuration is available by the activation date of Planogram. The system considers the Minimum and Maximum values for SOQ calcualtion "N" days before the Activation date of Planogram where "N" is calculated Offset value. Planogram Driven Replenishment The SOQ computation happens only when one of the Planogram is Active. Buffer days examples: Consider Planograms with the configurations below. Planogram Activation Date Deactivation Date Item Location Planogram1 Oct-01 Oct-30 Item1 Store1 Planogram2 Nov-15 Nov-30 Item1 Store1 When buffer days = 10, because the difference between the Deactivation and Activation of two Planograms < buffer days Replenishment will not change the life cycle policy on the SKU being deactivated Replenihsment will not enable the model set sell-down logic on the SKU prior to it being discontinued If buffer days = 16, because the difference between the Deactivation and Activation of two Planograms > buffer days Change the life cycle policy on the SKU being deactivated Enable the model set sell-down logic on the SKU prior to it being discontinued How to configure Replenishment parameters?
