Replenishment Planogram In this release, we’ve introduced an automated replenishment mechanism to align inventory with updated planograms. When a planogram changes, the system automatically replenishes the current assortment based on new planogram constraints, begins replenishment for new products introduced in the updated layout, and discontinues replenishment for products that are removed. This process is date-driven, activating or deactivating replenishment based on the configured active period for each Planogram. This enhancement ensures more efficient inventory management by accurately adjusting stock levels in response to planogram updates, optimizing replenishment for both existing and new assortments while reducing overstocking of discontinued items. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Planogram Item Location Deactivation In this release, we’ve introduced two new attributes, Activation Date and Deactivation Date, on the Item Location screen. These attributes provide enhanced flexibility in managing the availability of items at specific locations. By setting these dates, users can control when the system considers an item-location for generating new purchase orders. This feature is particularly useful for managing seasonal items, phased-out products, or temporary production halts, ensuring more accurate and efficient inventory management based on predefined availability periods. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Item Location Deactivation Maximum Economic Order Cycle Days From this release, Manhattan Active SCP introduces a new configuration at the Location and Item Inheritance Policy levels to establish a threshold for the Economic Order Cycle capping the Item Location Economic Order Cycle Days. This attribute is available under the Location Attributes container in the Location Inheritance Policy and the Item Planning Attributes container in the Item Inheritance Policy. If a value is set at the Location or Item Inheritance Policy level based on the Inheritance Hierarchy, the system applies the threshold at the Item Location Analysis Details level, ensuring that the Economic Order Cycle does not exceed the specified limit. On the Item Location Analysis Details screen, this field is non-editable. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Maximum Economic Order Cycle Days Bulk Update This release introduces the ability for users to perform bulk updates on the ItemLocation, ItemLocation Source, and Sourcing Relationships screens. This enhancement allows users to efficiently manage and update multiple records at once, streamlining workflows and saving time when making changes across large datasets. The bulk update action will be available on these screens, enabling users to apply changes to item locations, sourcing relationships, and related source information more effectively and in a consolidated manner. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Bulk Update Constrained Supply Allocation Constrained supply is a very common scenario in the supply chain. In this scenario, the inventory at the DC or source location is limited as compared to the requirements or need from the destination stores. The Constrained Supply Allocation feature in SCP optimizes inventory distribution when inventory at source location is limited. The system will consider various factors for the destination stores, like the committed quantities, safety stock etc. and recompute the suggested order quantities for the respective stores as per the constrained inventory available at the source location. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Constrained Supply Allocation New Store Modeling When retailers are launching new stores, they copy performance data like sales or forecasts from the existing stores. New store modeling allows users to select existing model stores and key performance data such as historical sales, forecast metrics, and attributes like velocity codes and slow mover status from the model stores to be copied over to the new stores. This data copied from the existing stores to the new stores can be used for planning the replenishment quantities for the new stores. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: New Store Modeling Network View and User Access This release enhances user access configuration for various screens in Supply Chain Planning. For Allocation screens (Allocators), user access can now be configured by using inventory attributes like Banner or Brand alongside traditional item attributes such as department or class.  For other supply chain screens, admin users can now configure user access by assigning teams for all sourcing relationships.  Users (Buyers) in respective teams will have access to data for corresponding sourcing relationships in various supply chain screens. Super users can view data across multiple sourcing relationships if they are part of multiple teams. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Network View and User Access Upper Echelon Standard Deviation This release introduces improved capabilities for measuring demand variability using Standard Deviation, including the new Upper Echelon Standard Deviation metric. Standard Deviation is essential for evaluating demand fluctuations across locations, helping businesses assess demand stability. A lower value indicates consistent demand, while a higher value reflects greater variability. The Upper Echelon Standard Deviation extends this analysis to higher echelon level locations, such as Distribution Centers (DCs) or Hub Stores, which support multiple downstream locations, including stores and other demand channels like online orders and preferred customers. These enhancements play a critical role in inventory planning, forecasting accuracy, cost optimization, service level improvements, risk management, and supplier coordination. By leveraging these insights, businesses can make more data-driven decisions, optimize inventory levels, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Multi-Echelon Service Investment Strategy (MESIS) The Multi-Echelon Service Investment Strategy (MESIS) aims to optimize inventory across all echelon levels of the supply chain, including distribution centers, and retail stores. This approach ensures that desired service levels (the ability to meet customer demand) are achieved with minimal safety stock. Instead of managing inventory at each level independently, the system now treats the entire network as a unified unit to calculate service levels and fill rates from the source location. Key enhancements include: The ability to trigger MESIS at the service group level by running the Higher Echelon Supplier Fill Rate Simulation (HESFRS) followed by the Service Investment Strategy (SIS) run for both Upper Echelon (UE) and Lower Echelon (LE). UI improvements that allow users to view MESIS results, apply them at the service group level, and analyze total item-location details, safety stock investments, and supplier fill rate calculations. Consideration of Conditional Expected Delay (CED) to refine lower-echelon inventory levels, enhancing stock replenishment accuracy. These enhancements enable smarter inventory planning and improved service level attainment while reducing excess inventory across the entire supply chain. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Multi-Echelon Service Investment Strategy (MESIS) Life Cycle Configuration Changes Currently, an item classified as Active or Inactive in one location may behave differently in another location due to inherited configurations. While Attribute Inheritance provides flexibility, it has led to inconsistencies and confusion for users. By centralizing these configurations within the lifeCycleStatus entity, the system ensures uniform behavior across all locations. As part of MASCP Release 25.2.2, the Life Cycle Configurations, which determine the replenishment and forecasting workflows of an item-location based on its Life Cycle Status (e.g., Active, Inactive, Discontinued), have been moved from the Item inheritance policy to the global the life Cycle Status configuration. This change ensures a more structured and consistent approach to managing life cycle status. With the upcoming Release 25.3.1, the Life cycle configurations from the Item inheritance Policy will be deprecated. While the Life Cycle Status (Active/Inactive) will continue to be inherited from Item inheritance Policy, the specific configurations associated with each status will no longer be inheritable from Item Inheritance Policy. Replenishment and Forecasting will refer to the global life cycle configurations for various life cycle status. Note: Only the system administrator has the ability to add or modify lifecycle statuses. Order Build Order Refresh Process In the previous release, we introduced the Order Refresh Process, designed to ensure that all relationships and item-locations are accurately re-evaluated and recalculated with each calendar date change. This enhancement addresses outdated Suggested Order Quantity (SOQ) calculations that previously resulted from configuration changes not being updated in real time. Running nightly, the Order Refresh Process recalculates SOQs and orders based on the most current configurations, ensuring consistency across all relationships and item locations. This improvement enhances the accuracy and reliability of SOQ calculations while optimizing inventory management. Additionally, it includes recalculations for orders in the "Review in Progress" state, ensuring they are accurately processed and reviewed based on the latest data. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Order Refresh Process Change Supplier with Subgroup and Temporary Supplier Change This enhancement improves the supplier change feature by enabling users to modify the primary source supplier even when the sourcing relationship involves multiple subgroups. Previously, changing the primary source was restricted to sources with a single or no subgroup. With this update, users can seamlessly update the primary supplier while ensuring that all subgroups within the sourcing relationship are updated accordingly, maintaining consistency and accuracy in procurement and supply chain operations. The Temporary Supplier Change feature allows businesses to switch from their primary supplier to an alternative supplier for a limited period. This is useful when the primary supplier faces delays, disruptions, or is unable to fulfill orders. To support this, Supply Chain Planning introduces two new configurable attributes: Override Source – Specifies the temporary supplier during the change period. Override Source End Date – Defines the end date for the temporary supplier relationship. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Change Supplier and Temporary Supplier Change Order Auto Release/Approval Enhancements In this release, we have implemented a change to prevent automatic order release or approval when an error code is encountered in IMS. This update applies to both sourcing relationships and order groups, ensuring that orders are not automatically processed in the event of an error. Enablement: This feature is controlled by grants and a configuration that is disabled by default. Related: Automatically Release Orders Order Split The Order Split feature allows suggested orders to be divided into multiple purchase orders (POs) based on specific constraints, such as truck size. This process splits a suggested order for a relationship into smaller POs that align with supplier requirements. Users can now configure supplier requirements before approving the order. Once the Order Split policy is configured, the system will automatically apply the Order Split logic when orders are automatically approved, ensuring efficient order management and compliance with supplier needs. The Order Split feature now includes two types of order splitting to better meet your needs: Splits the order based on order split constraints such as weight or number of pallets. Requirement Split: Orders are divided based on service requirements, with the most urgent order quantities appearing on the first order and the least urgent on the last. As a result, Sales Order Quantities (SOQs) may be split across multiple orders to prioritize demand. Line Split: Items are distributed in order in the same sequence as they appear. The Item listed at the top of the screen will be placed in the first order, and the Item at the bottom will be placed in the last order. These new split types enhance flexibility and ensure that orders are managed according to specific priorities and sequences. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Order Split PO Projections Purchase Order Projections provide insights into the ordering schedule for a specific timeframe for vendors, allowing them to plan ahead and ensure they have the required resources, materials, and capacity to efficiently meet the needs. By providing this information in advance, suppliers can better anticipate demand, optimize production, and allocate resources effectively, reducing the risk of stockouts, delays, or overproduction. In SCP Release 1, we introduced PO projections. With Release 25.2, we are enhancing this feature by incorporating additional factors such as bracketing, deals, and other relevant variables to provide more accurate projections. Users will now be able to view PO projections for configured days, and projections can be calculated based on user demand, in addition to the previously scheduled job. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: PO Projections Item Relationship(Supercession) - Deplete Higher Echelon Inventory & Accumulate Stock Status The Item Relationship Configuration has been enhanced with two new attributes: Deplete Higher Echelon Inventory: This attribute, with options ‘Yes’ and ‘No’, controls item relationship activation based on higher echelon inventory levels. When set to ‘Yes’, the relationship activates only when the higher echelon SKU's inventory is fully depleted, with the system validating inventory levels before activation. When set to ‘No’, activation occurs without inventory checks. The activation process is triggered as part of a calendar change event, such as a scheduled update or batch process, ensuring accurate inventory transitions. Accumulate Committed Qty to To Item: This attribute, defaulted to ‘No' enables the transfer of committed quantities from the FROM item to the TO item, including future commitments. The TO item will display these quantities when the Committed Begin Date (CBD) is greater than the CQ Begin Date. The system validates committed quantities in the FROM item before copying and automatically updates the TO item whenever changes occur. Periodic system checks ensure the TO item maintains the most accurate committed quantity. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Item Relationship Add Notes (Suggested Order) The Add Notes enhancement enables users to add, edit, and manage notes on the suggested order page, improving collaboration and order communication. Notes can be added at the order level, with options to edit, override, delete, and track modifications with user details and timestamps. A new widget allows easy note management, and a ‘Print on PO’ option ensures important comments appear on final orders. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Notes Renumbering Purchase Order from Interfaced Value This release introduces a new user exit, InventoryOptimization:Order:UserExit:GenerateOrderId, to handle the renumbering of purchase orders (POs) based on updated vendor information in the Preactive DFIO system. When an order is created in MASCP with a specific order Id, it may receive a different Id in the vendor’s system. This user exit will be triggered during the order approval process—both automatic and manual—before the reservation is created in the replenishment and allocation flow. The exit will take input parameters such as Source Location, Source Location Type, Movement Type, Location Id, Sub Group and return the updated Order Id in response. This enhancement ensures seamless synchronization between MASCP and vendor systems, improving PO management. Location Inheritance Policy - New Attributes With this release, the Location Inheritance Policy has been enhanced to support additional attributes, providing greater flexibility and configurability in supply chain planning. As part of this enhancement, the values configured in the Location Inheritance Policy will now be automatically inherited by the Sourcing Relationship where the Location is the destination. Demand Forecasting Aggregate Seasonal Profiling The Aggregated Seasonal Profile feature enhances forecasting accuracy by using seasonal trends at higher hierarchical levels, such as Department for items and Region for locations. This functionality is particularly beneficial for item-locations with limited historical sales data, allowing them to leverage shared sales patterns within the defined hierarchy. Aggregate seasonal profiles are influenced by the hierarchy levels and filter conditions configured in the seasonal profile policy, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to different business needs. Forecasting now benefits from user-provided aggregate seasonal profiles, enhancing accuracy and adaptability. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Aggregated Seasonal Profiling Future Manual and Seed Forecast Previously, the current Seasonalized Forecast value could be edited from the General tab, along with a few other pieces of information that belong to the current period. While this feature continues to be supported, the latest release introduces the Forecast Adjustments Panel, accessible from the Forecast Details – History and Projections tab. When a user selects a future period data row from the data grid, this panel is displayed on the right, while current or past data rows remain non-editable.  Users can perform actions such as manual forecast changes and freezing forecast values for a future period.  These changes are saved as a Manual Forecast Event, which triggers the backend code to process the changes, sync up, refresh, and reload the data grid and the graph on the left panel.  The Forecast API is then sent to IO for SOQ calculation. The same Forecast Adjustment Panel can also be used for entering future seed forecasts before the first period of demand.  This enhancement enables greater control and flexibility in managing forecast changes, ensuring accurate and up-to-date forecasts for future period projections based on manual inputs. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Forecast Details UI The new Forecast Details UI complements the current Forecast UI, consolidating the functionality of manual forecast changes, future forecast adjustments, freeze forecast, seed forecast, and forecast details review into a single, streamlined user interface. This update introduces a graphical representation of sales, forecasts, and seasonality, making it easier for users to visualize trends and to make data-driven decisions. The Forecast Projections tab now includes additional data points, offering a more comprehensive view of other factors influencing the weekly forecast projections. This enhancement improves forecast visibility, benefiting users by making it easier to review and edit forecast information. To facilitate comprehensive analysis, the Forecast Projections tab has been enhanced and renamed to History and Projections.  This updated tab now features a data grid and chart, providing key insights through: Historical seasonalized forecast, sales, and promotional demand Current and future seasonalized forecast Users can now assess the validity of both current and future forecast projections, identify exceptions and anomalies, and compare historical sales and forecast history for troubleshooting purposes. From the History and Projections tab, users can select a particular future period forecast to edit, and a right panel is provided to make necessary adjustments to the seasonalized forecast and to freeze the forecast.  Upon saving, changes on the right panel will be reflected on the main tab. Changes to the current seasonal forecast and policy settings can be made from the first two tabs by clicking on the widget that has the relevant information. The next forecast update process will calculate the forecast using this manually entered seasonal forecast and policy settings. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Forecast Analysis Forecast Summary Managing forecasts at the individual item location level can be inefficient and time-consuming.  The Forecast Summary feature provides the ability to summarize leaf-level forecasts into manageable groups of items and locations, providing visibility into sales history, current forecast and future forecast projections, as well as forecast exception counts. Forecast Summary Analysis UI displays a data grid and charts, summarizing key data points: Historical seasonalized forecast, sales, and promotional demand Current and future seasonalized forecast Forecast exception counts Users can review forecasts and forecast exceptions at the summary level and make necessary changes to the summary-level seasonalized forecasts.  The system then proportionally disaggregates these changes down to the corresponding leaf level forecasts. For example, a client can create forecasts at the individual item location level and then summarize them by item across all locations.  Instead of managing demand for each item location, users can efficiently summarize and manage each item’s total demand for the entire enterprise.  Changes to the forecast summary value are proportionally disaggregated back to the item location forecast. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release.
