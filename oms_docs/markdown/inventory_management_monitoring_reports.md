The data for these reports is mainly derived from the Inventory component. These reports provide insights into the inventory configurations in the Available to Commerce component, inventory levels across different stages, store capacity, etc. The following points summarize the key highlights of these reports: Inventory Tracking: The Inventory Management Monitoring reports help warehouse/store managers track the number of quantities ordered, allocated, released, shipped, and indicate locations with negative inventory and stores with negative capacity. This information is helpful for them to maintain appropriate inventory levels to fulfil customer orders efficiently and promptly. Available To Commerce (ATC) Configurations: The ATC reports under the Inventory Management Monitoring header provide the configuration details of the ATC component. This information can help users to define or modify the availability rules over time. Sync Records: The Inventory Management Monitoring reports also include reports on sync records. These reports inform users whether the inbound and outbound inventory records are synced with the external systems or not for different locations. These reports also indicate if there are any sync failures. Common Prompts You can access the Inventory Management Monitoring reports in IBM Cognos by navigating to Team Content > SCI Packaged Content > Reports > OMNI > Inventory Management > Monitoring Reports. The following table explains some of the prompts used in these reports: Prompt Name Description Configuration Name Multiple configurations are added to the commerce view to allow retailers to define different availability rules over a given period. The Configuration Name prompt includes a list of such configurations applied to the Available to Commerce component of Enterprise Inventory. Sync Process Status Inventory sync helps to reconcile the inventory snapshot between the warehouse or storage system and the Inventory component. The Sync Process Status prompt includes the following: Sync Started: This status indicates that the sync is initiated for a particular location. Aborted: This status implies that a new sync message is sent to the location for which the sync is in progress, then the old sync is aborted with status as Aborted. Completed: This status indicates that sync is completed for a particular location. Validation Failed: This status indicates that sync fails Business/Data validation, then the sync is aborted with the status as Validations failed. Inventory Supply Product Status This prompt includes the following statuses: Active: This status represents goods in an active peak location and are ready to be picked. Finished Goods: This status represents goods that are ready to be sold to customers. NA: This status represents the Inventory Supply Product setting with NA value. Order Type This prompt represents the type of orders, such as call center orders, e-commerce orders, return orders, etc. These order types are defined in the Enterprise Inventory component of MAO. The following set of reports  can be used to study inventory management processes and ensure everything runs smoothly.
