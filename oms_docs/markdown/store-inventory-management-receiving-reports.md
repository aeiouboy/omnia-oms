Operational SCI for MAO includes Store Inventory Management (SIM) - Receiving reports that derive data from the Receiving component, helping retailers to track packages that are received, not received, yet to be received, and missing. It also gives you all the details of the package and at the item level. You can access the SIM - Receiving reports in IBM Cognos by navigating to Team Content > SCI Packaged Content > Reports > OMNI > Store Inventory Management - Receiving. Common Prompts The following table summarizes some of the common prompts for SIM - Receiving reports: Prompt Name Description Delivery Type The delivery type on the package indicates whether the inventory will be restocked or staged for pickup by the customer. The following are delivery types and their descriptions: Customer Pickup: The package will be staged for pickup. Store Inventory: Contents of the package are not (directly) tied to customer orders. Packages received for store replenishment, pullbacks/transfers, and store-initiated transfers have delivery types as store inventory. Store Stock: Stock available in store for customers Transfer: Transfers are small orders sent from one store location to another to replenish the receiving store's inventory or to rebalance inventory across store locations. Ship From and Ship To Location These include the original location and destination location of the packages. Date Range These include Receipt Dates and Shipped Dates, Estimated Delivery Dates.
