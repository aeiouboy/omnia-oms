Managers can use these reports to monitor specific concerns, such as fraudulent activity (Fraud Orders by Day Report), processing irregularities (Price Override Report, Order Lines On Hold Report), late orders (Late Orders List Report) and stuck orders (Store Orders Aging Summary Report, Released Order Inactivity Report). In addition, many of the reports are tools for managing order processing (Open Orders Report) and inventory (Order Value by Time Report). Common Report Prompts: You can access the Order Management reports in IBM Cognos by navigating to Team Content > SCI Packaged Content > Reports > OMNI > Order Management. The following table describes some of the common prompts for many of the Order Management reports: Prompt Description Selling Channel This prompt provides you with a list of selling channels through which orders can be placed. The list includes store, call center, website, and selfserve. These selling channels are configured in the Order Management component of Active Omni and when an order is imported, the selling channel is also validated against the configured values. Order Type Customers can place their orders through different channels, such as e-commerce, stores, centers, and more. The Order component of MAO assigns each order to an order type in the Order component. This prompt includes those types, and you can select one or multiple order types for your reporting requirements. Order Status Each order status is represented by a numerical value in the Order Management component. The examples of these statuses are as follows: 1000 - Open / Created 1500 - Back Ordered 2000 - Allocated 3000 - Released 3500 - In process To view the complete list, you can refer to the Order Orchestration Process page.
