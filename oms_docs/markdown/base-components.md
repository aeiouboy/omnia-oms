Implementation Flavor Hiding base panels Base panels can be hidden. For example, we can hide&nbsp;the shipping method panel in the Item Details&nbsp;screen. This can also be used to replace a&nbsp;base panel with a custom panel. To do this,&nbsp;hide the base panel using this configuration and show the custom panel using an&nbsp;iFrame extension. Note: No new extension points for hiding base panels&nbsp;will be provided. We have introduced an&nbsp;extension type &#39;Base Component&#39; with&nbsp;features including&nbsp;hiding base panels. Conditional hiding of base buttons Base buttons/tabs can be hidden. For example,&nbsp;to hide or disable the base buttons/tab (proceed to payment button/payment tab), you can use condition Query for condition available at the entity or conditionURL to hit a custom API. The response of the API should be as below for the button/tab to be disabled/hidden { &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;result&quot;: false } } The configuration should be: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ExtensionId&quot;: &quot;edit-order-payment-tab-hide&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ExtensionDetail&quot;: [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ExtensionType&quot;: &quot;base-component&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ExtensionProperties&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;IsDisabled&quot;: true, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ConditionURL&quot;: https://demo7004666.mockable.io/installmentoptions &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } &nbsp; &nbsp; ] } &nbsp; Note: Base component (hiding base button) does not allow possibility of tooltip or override text. Condition query to compare base price with selling price Display the selling price and the base price on the Item Details UI so that Contact center associates can tell the customer how much they are saving.&nbsp; Condition:&nbsp; If base price &gt; selling price, show the base price with a slash through it The UI extension framework allows comparing only one dynamic value of format a.b = c; where a-&gt; is the entity, b-&gt; is the attribute and c is the literal. Example: Order.IsOnHold == true. Order.OrderType.OrderTypeId == &lsquo;mPos order&rsquo;. To achieve the above condition,&nbsp;&nbsp;the /pricepromo/itemPrice/list API call has to be intercepted.&nbsp; A check has to be performed&nbsp;for ItemPriceResponseDetail.BasePrice != ItemPriceResponseDetail.SellingPrice in the&nbsp;custom code and populate a boolean attribute to hold its result and check for the same boolean value in the&nbsp;ConditionQuery. Troubleshooting Conditional URL to hide the base fields on add credit card based on custom validation is not working Issue: Customer has a requirement to limit payment by a maximum of one credit card. The condition URL is not working for the add-credit-card extension.&nbsp;Below is the response from the condition URL: { &quot;success&quot;: true, &quot;header&quot;: null, &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;Hidden&quot;: true, &quot;Disabled&quot;: true }, &quot;messageKey&quot;: null, &quot;message&quot;: null, &quot;errors&quot;: [], &quot;exceptions&quot;: [], &quot;messages&quot;: { &quot;Message&quot;: [], &quot;Size&quot;: 0 }, &quot;statusCode&quot;: &quot;OK&quot; } Troubleshooting Steps:&nbsp;To hide the base fields for adding cards based on custom validation, the Hide check box should be selected, and the conditional URL response should be as&nbsp;mentioned below: { &quot;success&quot;: true, &quot;header&quot;: null, &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;result&quot;: false }, &quot;messageKey&quot;: null, &quot;message&quot;: null, &quot;errors&quot;: [], &quot;exceptions&quot;: [], &quot;messages&quot;: { &quot;Message&quot;: [], &quot;Size&quot;: 0 }, &quot;statusCode&quot;: &quot;OK&quot; } Related Articles Field ExtensionsLeft Navigation MenuPatternsiFramesExtension Util FunctionsIntercept UI API CallsBest PracticesOverviewButtons
