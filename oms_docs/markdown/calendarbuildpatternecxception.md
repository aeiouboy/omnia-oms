Calendars can be customized with recurring patterns, like excluding Saturdays and Sundays from order review days. Specific non-business days, such as holidays like Christmas, can also be set to ensure accurate scheduling and operations. Process Flow The entities involved in these configurations are: DayOfWeekPattern CalendarDateException &nbsp; The various business activities defined on calendar Day of week pattern are as follows. Selling Day - Indicates whether this is a selling day for the destination location. Business Day - Indicates whether this day is open for business or not. Orders cannot be made to a source BE on a day that&rsquo;s not a valid business day. Shipping Day - Indicates whether an order can be shipped from the source location on this day. Order Review Day - Indicates this is an order review day. Transportation Day - Indicates whether this is a transportation day for the source location. Receiving Day - Indicates whether an order can be received at the destination location on this day. &nbsp; Calendar Day of Week ID:&nbsp;The Calendar Day of Week Id in the Day of Week Pattern identifies specific weekdays. For example, if the Receiving Day is unchecked for a particular weekday, alternate receiving options can be specified, such as: Alternate Receiving Day: A different day selected for receiving. Alternate Receiving Direction: Specifies the direction in which the alternate receiving occurs. &nbsp; Calendar Date Exceptions:&nbsp;The Calendar Date Exceptions entity contains the same fields as the Day of Week Pattern, with the addition of: Begin Date: The start date of the exception. End Date: The end date of the exception. The defined exception applies to all days within the specified period between the Begin Date and End Date.
