The CSRs can get information about the customer they are dealing with. The dashboard allows the CSR to view basic information about recent orders, information about how important the customer is to the retailer, and view the previous contact details of the customer with customer service. It enables the CSR to drill into&nbsp;various attributes for additional details. The customer dashboard provides the following details: Customer Details:&nbsp;Displays the customer details such as the name, status, weather, email address, phone number, Facebook, Twitter, and purchase history bar. Customer Metrics: Displays the customer order/return analytics such as the purchase, fulfillment, and delivery/shipping methods associated with the customer.
