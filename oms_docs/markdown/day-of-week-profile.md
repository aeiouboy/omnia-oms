Such a behaviour is represented as a Day of Week Profile, similar to the Seasonal Profile for an item being sold at a particular location and can be used in addition to Forecast and Seasonal indices so that the daily rise and fall in demand can be predicted upfront and inventory can be managed accordingly. Use Cases Weekly forecasts generated by forecasting algorithms can be split into daily forecasts using DOW profiles. Retailers with different day-wise sales trends can apply custom profiles at different levels (e.g., SKU, item-location). Overrides to profiles allow businesses to quickly adjust to known upcoming changes in demand (e.g., promotions). Process Flow The Day of Week (DOW) profiling process begins within the ai-forecast system, where it concurrently fetches the item-related policy filter conditions and initiates an Item Search. This action triggers a call to the Day of Week Profile item system, which queries the OMNI-Items data store to retrieve a list of items that match the specified filters. These items are then published to a message queue labelled "Queue: Publish Items" for further processing. Simultaneously, ai-forecast also retrieves the location-related policy filter conditions, which include parameters such as the Day of Week pattern and lifecycle configuration. This information is sent to the ai-inventory optimization system, which accesses the location and item-location data stores to return a filtered list of applicable locations and item-locations. Once ai-forecast has the item and location context, it initiates a call to the ai-demand metrics system to fetch daily historical metrics for each item-location combination. This is done through a REST API call to ai-demand metrics/metric/search, which retrieves day-wise data from the availability cache (CACHE), where the most recent year’s history is stored. With all the required data gathered—items, locations, and daily metrics—ai-forecast proceeds to generate the Day of Week Profile for each item-location. The resulting profiles, which represent daily demand distribution patterns, are then stored in the Day of Week Profile Result data store, completing the profiling process. This end-to-end workflow ensures accurate DOW profiles are generated based on real-time item, location, and demand history data. Day of Week Profile and its Usage: Day of week profile helps users to define a daily selling pattern over a week for any given item location. It gives a graphical representation of demand over the week in the form of indices which can be modified by the user. DOW profiles are a series of seven indices, one for each day of the week. Demand Forecasting normalizes the indices so that they all add up to seven. New item locations (which usually do not have a demand history) and slow-moving item Locations (which may not sell enough to determine a daily pattern) could benefit from DOW profiles. Location Default Day of Week Profile: This type of Day of Week profile is created for a location hierarchy node or a specific location ID. Each location default profile can have only one location ID or hierarchy node, and it will have a default index value of 1 across all days of the week. The location default profiles can be created and linked to the day of week policy and get it associated with relevant Forecast entities through FI/FU OR they can also be associated to FE’s directly on the Forecasts UI. Users Day of Week Policy: A "Day of Week" policy can be created using the Day of Week Policy UI and linked to relevant Day of Week profiles. This policy can also be associated with a forecast policy, which facilitates the automatic association of Day of Week profiles with matching forecast entities (FEs). Configurations To leverage Day of Week profiling within your forecasting process, you will: 1) Create DOW Policy from the Day of Week Policy UI 2) Create Location Default Profile from Day of Week Profile UI , link the Day of week profile to a day of week policy from the “Day of Week Policy Id” field while creating the profile (This is typically set up as a prerequisite business process). 3) Link DOW Policy to Forecast Policy: Associate a DOW Policy with a specific Forecast Policy. This ensures that items processed under that Forecast Policy will consider the Day of Week patterns defined by the linked DOW Policy for lost sales calculations. 4) Link DOW Profile to a specific Forecast: For granular control, you can also link a specific DOW Profile directly to an individual forecast (item-location combination). This profile will then be used for that specific forecast's lost sales calculation. 5)The system then uses these linked DOW patterns to refine lost sales estimations, leading to more accurate forecasts and inventory management.

Navigate to Forecast Policies: From the main menu, go to Forecasts > Forecast Policy. Select or Create a Policy: To edit an existing policy, select it from the list and click Edit. To create a new policy, click Create New (or similar button). Locate the "Day of Week Policy Id" field: In the Forecast Policy Definition section of the Forecast Policy screen, find the new field labeled Day of Week Policy Id. (Hint: This field is typically placed near "Metric Group Id".) Select a Day of Week Policy: Click the search icon (magnifying glass) next to the Day of Week Policy Id field. A lookup window will appear. Choose from the lookup: Select the desired Day of Week Policy from the list and confirm your selection. Save Changes: Click Save or Save & Continue to apply the changes to the Forecast Policy. Link a Day of Week Profile to a Specific Forecast This allows you to apply a specific Day of Week Profile directly to an individual forecast for a particular item-location association. Navigate to Forecasts: From the main menu, go to Forecasts > Forecasts (to view the list of individual forecasts). Select a Forecast: Select and open a specific forecast record from the list. Locate the "Day of Week Profile Id" field: In the FORECAST POLICY DETAILS section of the Forecast Details screen, find the new field labeled Day of Week Profile Id. Note: This field is often under History Used. Select a Day of Week Profile: Click the search icon next to the Day of Week Profile Id field. A lookup window will appear. Choose from the lookup: Select the desired Day of Week Profile from the list and confirm your selection. Save Changes: Click Save (or similar button) to apply the changes to the forecast.
