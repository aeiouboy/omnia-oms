This includes assigning the optimistic and the pessimistic order delivery dates once the order is reserved. These dates are used to&nbsp;ensure that the order meets the requested delivery date (RDD.) These dates can also be used&nbsp;to provide possible delivery dates to the end customer. After a&nbsp;promising completes and an order is reserved, rescheduling is triggered if a reservation&nbsp;transfer occurs from one future inventory to another (PO to ASN or ASN to PO), or during ETA updates on future inventory.
