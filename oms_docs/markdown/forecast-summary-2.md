This improves efficiency and visibility by offering insights into sales history, current forecasts, and future projections, along with forecast exception counts. By reducing the complexity of handling forecasts at an individual item-location level, this feature enhances decision-making and operational efficiency. Forecast Summary Analysis UI displays a data grid and charts, summarizing key data points: Historical seasonalized forecast, sales, and promotional demand Current and future seasonalized forecast Forecast exception counts Users can review forecasts and forecast exceptions at the summary level and make necessary changes to the summary-level seasonalized forecasts. The system then proportionally disaggregates these changes down to the corresponding leaf level forecasts. For example, a client can create forecasts at the individual item-location level and then summarize them by item across all locations. Instead of managing demand for each item-location separately, users can efficiently summarize and manage the total demand for each item across the entire enterprise. Any changes made to the forecast summary value are proportionally disaggregated back to the item-location forecast. Forecast Summary Policy The Forecast Summary Policy governs the process of summarizing forecasts. &nbsp;Leaf level forecasts must first be generated, then based on the forecast summary policy, the relevant values are summarized. Creating a Forecast Summary Policy To summarize forecasts, users need to create a Forecast Summary Policy. &nbsp;The process involves several steps: Step 1: Policy Definition Forecast Summary Policy Id and Description Active status: Forecast summary will be generated if this flag is set to Yes. Purpose Type: Defaulted to “Replenishment”, which is the application that will be consuming of the forecasts.&nbsp; Only forecasts with this matching purpose type will be summarized.&nbsp; Step 2: Grouping Attributes Users can add item grouping attributes and the corresponding grouping sequence.&nbsp; Currently, the only supported item grouping attribute is Item Id.&nbsp; Users can add location grouping attributes and the corresponding grouping sequence.&nbsp; If a location grouping attribute is not specified, then the location is grouped at the enterprise level, meaning that there is only one location group per item group, which is for all locations.&nbsp; For example, the forecast for Item ABC will be summarized for all locations.&nbsp; Step 3: Filter Conditions Users can define filter conditions for items.&nbsp; If filter conditions are not configured, then the system will summarize forecasts for all items. &nbsp;Users can define filter conditions for locations.&nbsp; If filter conditions are not configured, then the system will summarize forecasts for all locations. Multiple filter attribute values can be entered, separated by a comma. Triggering the Summarization Process The forecast summary process is triggered for active policies during Forecast Initiation and Forecast Update. The system summarizes all forecasts that meet the criteria entered the Forecast Policy and stores this information, which is visible from the Forecast Summaries UI. Forecast Summaries UI The Forecast Summaries UI provides a comprehensive view of all system-generated forecast summaries. &nbsp; The list page displays Forecast Summary Id, Forecast Summary Policy Id, Item Grouping, Location Grouping and summations of Forecast values. &nbsp;Users can sort summary records by any columns, with the default sort being the Forecast Summary Policy Id. List Page Actions In addition to reviewing forecasts at the summarized level, a user can perform a few actions: Export data to a spreadsheet (.csv) from the list page.&nbsp; Review the Forecast Summary Details. Edit the Seasonalized Forecast Sum.&nbsp; Forecast Summary Details Details of the forecast summary include links to other relevant UIs. The header section displays the same fields that are displayed on the list page. History & Projections Tab This tab displays a data grid and a chart with forecast summary data. Users can view summarized historical data and projections by Period such as Period Start, Cleansed Sales Sum, Sales Sum, Lost Sales Sum, Promotional Demand Sum, historical, current and future Seasonalized Forecast Sum. Exceptions Tab This tab displays total forecast exception counts by exception type. Various widgets display the counts of demand and forecast exceptions, new item locations, filtered forecast exceptions, and automatic forecast adjustments for forecasts that belong to this summary. Details Page Actions The following actions are supported by the details page: Clear exceptions from all relevant forecasts that belong to this summary. Edit the Seasonalized Forecast Sum as needed. Once edited, clicking the "Submit" button saves the Seasonalized Forecast Sum and initiates an asynchronous service to proportionally disaggregate the adjusted sum to the corresponding forecast records. Note: Until this process is complete, the other numbers on the screen may temporarily be out of sync. Configurations Required Configurations: API and UI Settings: Users need access to relevant APIs and UI components. Grouping Attributes: Selection of item and location attributes for summarization. Filters: Applying forecast summary filters based on business requirements. Scheduler Setup: Ensuring timely forecast updates. Forecast Summary { &nbsp; &quot;forecastSummaryPolicyId&quot;: &quot;12345&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Monthly Demand Forecast&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;active&quot;: true, &nbsp; &quot;groupingAttributes&quot;: { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;item&quot;: &quot;ItemId&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;location&quot;: &quot;Region&quot; &nbsp; }, &nbsp; &quot;filters&quot;: [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { &quot;attribute&quot;: &quot;Department&quot;, &quot;values&quot;: [&quot;Women&quot;, &quot;Men&quot;] } &nbsp; ] } Implementation Flavors Retail-Specific Customization: Users can extend forecast policies to fit unique business needs.
