If there is an allocation strategy defined for the allocator and style/Item, at the source location, then that strategy is picked up during allocation. Otherwise, the system looks for a strategy without any allocator assignment. This page is accessible by administrators only.&nbsp;Each allocator assignment can be configured at the Source Location Id and Item Hierarchy Levels.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Filters:&nbsp; Allocator Source Location Id Approver Hierarchy Level 1 Hierarchy Level 2 Hierarchy Level 3 Hierarchy Level 4 Hierarchy Level 5 Hierarchy Level 6 Note:&nbsp;Only six hierarchy filters will be displayed in the filter panel. Users can add&nbsp;the rest of the hierarchy levels from the&nbsp;Available Filters&nbsp;section in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Customize Filters&nbsp;window.&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating Allocator Assignment &nbsp; To create an&nbsp;allocator assignment: Select Menu&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Configurations&nbsp; &gt; User &gt; Allocator Assignments Click&nbsp;Create&nbsp;to view the&nbsp;Create&nbsp;New&nbsp;Allocator Assignment&nbsp;wizard.&nbsp; From the&nbsp;Create Allocator Assignment&nbsp;section, Select Source Location Id from the drop-down list.

Hierarchy Level 1 must be defined before Hierarchy Level 2 and so on.&nbsp; The first hierarchy level value drop-down contains distinct entries from the corresponding field in the Item entity.&nbsp;The next hierarchy level value drop-down contains distinct entities from the corresponding field in Item entity with matching hierarchy values in the previous level.&nbsp;All higher hierarchy levels must be defined.&nbsp; Select Approver from the drop-down list. Choose Yes or No for Submitted Allocation Requires Approval. Click&nbsp;Save and Continue. On the Allocator Team Assignment page,&nbsp; Click Create.
