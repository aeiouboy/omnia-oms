The auto-release process can consider order exceptions configured to stop auto-release. Users can configure orders to be released regardless of any exceptions, or prevent release if exceptions are present or order level thresholds are not met. Additionally, auto-release can be disabled for a relationship or order group. &nbsp; Process Flow Configuration &nbsp; How to set automatically release control at Sourcing Relationship and Order Group Automatically Release Orders configuration on Sourcing Relationship and Order Group. Options: Always - Orders are always released, regardless of any thresholds or order exceptions configured to stop auto-release. Never - Order is not considered for auto-release. Stop on Exception - Order is auto-released if the order does not have any order exceptions with &#39;Stop Auto Order Release&#39; = Yes, and order totals are within auto-release thresholds.&nbsp; Set Automatically Release Control {{url}}/itemlocation/api/itemlocation/sourcingRelationship/save {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;SourceLocationId&quot;: &quot;DC1&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LocationId&quot;: &quot;Store23&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;OrderCycle&quot;: &quot;7&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OrderDueMethod&quot;: &quot;SCHEDULE WITH SOQs&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;RelationType&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;RelationTypeId&quot;: &quot;Regular&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;AutoReleaseType&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AutoReleaseTypeId&quot;: &quot;Always&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } } &nbsp; *Auto Release Types* Never&nbsp; Always&nbsp; Stop on Exception How to configure Auto Release Thresholds Configuration on Sourcing Relationship and Order Group where minimum and maximum order level thresholds can be defined by unit of measure (UOM). Auto Release Thresholds are checked when Automatically Release Orders are set to &#39;Stop on Exception&#39;. Auto-release thresholds are not mandatory. Order exceptions configured to stop auto release are still checked when thresholds are not configured. Only one threshold per unit of measure (UOM) is allowed. If a second threshold is added with the same UOM as an existing one, the new minimum and maximum values will override the previous ones for that UOM.
