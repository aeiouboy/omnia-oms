This is achieved by storing the API data locally and re-using it during subsequent logins, thus reducing the time to log in to the application. Technical Benefits: Performance Boost: Reduces API load and latency during repeated logins. Improved UX: Allows faster access to operational screens, especially in high-traffic retail environments. Note: The local data stored on the device is by the user. This is refreshed every day&nbsp;upon first login.&nbsp; If mandatory configuration is changed (this will not be detected automatically). Users are suggested to use the POS Setting page and refresh&nbsp;the configuration manually. This capability is&nbsp; enabled by the grant “ui::devicemgmt::user::refreshconfiguration” Configuration This feature can be enabled through&nbsp;Store Registers configuration. By default,&nbsp;"Navigate to Page After Login" will be empty. Configure this attribute to "Cart" to enable this capability. This will allow the capability of local storage of data during first login. And navigate directly to the Cart screen. This configuration is enabled at register level. So all users on the registers will have this capability. Direct Login Process This capability enables users to log in directly to a pre-configured page within the store application on subsequent logins for the same business day. Find a more detailed explanation below. Initial Login (First Login of the Day): Upon successful authentication, the application invokes a set of configuration APIs (e.g., store settings, user roles, permissions, layout preferences). The returned configuration data is serialized and securely stored locally on the device—typically using local storage or an encrypted cache. The target screen (in this case, the Cart screen) is registered based on store profile settings. Subsequent Logins (Same Business Day): When the same user logs in again on the same day, the application: Skips calling the configuration APIs. Validates the locally stored configuration against session or date markers. Directly launches the Cart screen using the locally cached configuration data, minimizing backend dependency and reducing login time. Area of Relevance: This direct login and screen navigation logic currently supports only the Cart screen. It is triggered only if: The user is re-logging in on the same business day. Local configuration is available and valid. Grants or configurations are updated: If mandatory configuration/grants are changed, manual refresh can be triggered from the POS Settings using "Refresh Configuration". "ui::devicemgmt::user::refreshconfiguration" is required to access this grant and&nbsp;"Navigate to Page After Login" = "Cart" Updates to POS Settings and impact on direct login Direct login works based on the business flag configured&nbsp;on store registers, so updates like clear all, unregister will have an impact on the direct&nbsp;login feature. If you are unregistering a device, and registering for a new register, then based on the business flag configured&nbsp;on the store register, the direct login will be enabled or disabled. If "Clear All" is performed, then the local database of store application is cleared. Upon registering the device, it will store the database based on store register and business flag settings. If you update any peripheral data on POS Settings, then this information is saved in the local database and on the backend, so it will be persisted whenever you re-login to the application. Keynotes for direct login This capability is only applicable to the new Cart UI. Enable "Direct login" only if the register is for POS checkout. If the user does not have grants or cannot access the cart screen, then it falls back to the home screen. Uninstallation or re-installation will reset the local storage, so the first login after installation will make all mandatory calls and will take more time than the subsequent login process. If the&nbsp;"Navigate to Page After Login" &nbsp;is empty or setup as home screen, then the direct login will be disabled. The direct login feature will only work when&nbsp;all&nbsp;mandatory APIs are saved in the local device database. If 1 of the APIs fails, then local storage is reset. If grants or configuration for the user/store are updated in the middle of the day. Then use the "Refresh Configuration" to reload all mandatory APIs&nbsp;and other configuration data. &nbsp;
