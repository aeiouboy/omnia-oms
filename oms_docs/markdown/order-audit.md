The order audit trail logs every&nbsp;update to the&nbsp;audited fields, including updates made by a user and&nbsp;the system.&nbsp;If an entity or attribute is updated by the system, then the log indicates that the update was performed by a system user.&nbsp;The audit trail cannot be modified by the user. Process Flow Order Audit Process Flow How Order Audit Works By default, the Audit Trail displays records for all order lines. Optionally, a user can filter for a single order line by inputting the order line ID and clicking Apply.&nbsp;The text box does not support type-ahead search and is not case-sensitive. When filtering for an order line, audit records will only be shown for records that have&nbsp;Entity Name =&nbsp;OrderLine. This means if a line&nbsp;has child objects such as charge details and tax details which were modified, the audit of those child objects is not displayed when filtering for the line. Clicking on Apply with no text in the order line text box will return results for the entire order.&nbsp; Only the latest 10,000 records of the audit trail are&nbsp;displayed in the Audit Trail UI. To&nbsp;access the full order audit, use the rest API: GET&nbsp;/order/api/audit/OrderId?size=2000 Each&nbsp;order audit trail record comprises of the following fields: Field Name Description Changed Parameter The attribute or entity that was modified. For example, when Customer Id&nbsp;is&nbsp;modified, Changed Parameter = &quot;CustomerId&quot;. When a new appeasement is applied,&nbsp;Changed Parameter = &quot;OrderChageDetail&quot;. Activity Indicates if the record (attribute or entity) was&nbsp;Added, Updated, or Deleted based on the following logic: If an audit&nbsp;trail record has Old Value null and New Value not null, then Activity = Added If an audit trail record has both Old Value and New Value not null, then Activity =&nbsp;Updated New Value The updated value of the change. For example, when Customer Id&nbsp;is changed&nbsp;from CUS003 to CUS008, then New Value =&nbsp;CUS008. Old Value The former value of the change. For example, when Customer Id is changed from CUS003 to CUS008, then Old Value = CUS003. Entity Name Name of the entity to which the Changed Parameter belongs. For example, when ordered quantity changes, the Entity Name =&nbsp;OrderLine.&nbsp; Entity Id Unique&nbsp;identifier of the entity to which Changed Parameter belongs to.&nbsp;For example, when ordered quantity changes, the Entity Id&nbsp;=&nbsp;OrderLineId.&nbsp; Parent entity Name Name of the parent entity of Entity Id. For example, when ordered quantity changes, Parent entity Name = &quot;Order&quot;. If there is no parent entity, then it remains null.&nbsp; Parent entity Id Unique identifier of the parent entity. For example, when ordered quantity changes, parent entity Id = OrderId.&nbsp;If there is no parent entity, then it remains&nbsp;null.&nbsp; Grand Parent entity Name Name of the parent entity. For example, when order line notes are updated, Grandparent entity Name = &quot;Order&quot;.&nbsp;If there is no grandparent entity, then it remains null.&nbsp; Grand Parent entity Id Unique identifier of grandparent entity. For example, when order line notes are updated, Grandparent entity Id = OrderId.&nbsp;If there is no&nbsp;grandparent&nbsp;entity, then it remains&nbsp;null.&nbsp; Updated By The Id&nbsp;of the user who updated the Changed Parameter. If it has been modified by the system or another component, then user Id is System. Updated Time The timestamp at which the Changed Parameter was updated. Anonymize Customer Data on Order Audit Trail To anonymize the customer data on the order audit, update the &ldquo;IsAnonymized&rdquo; flag to true on the order (OrderAdditional.IsAnonymized) which triggers the&nbsp;anonymizing customer data on the order audit. The following fields will&nbsp;be anonymized: Order.First Name Order.Last Name Order.Email Order.Phone OrderLine.ShiptoAddress Order.CustomerId Note: &lsquo;IsAnonymized&rsquo; flag cannot be updated back to false or null after updating to true. By default, &#39;Anonymous&#39; value will be updated in the customer info fields on the order and payment header. This cannot be customized to change to another value. To anonymize customer data on the payment audit, update the &quot;IsAnonymized&quot; flag to true on the payment header. The following will be anonymized&nbsp;on the payment header, Payment Billing Address CustomerID NameOnCard Implementation Flavors NA Related Articles Mod TypesShipping RestrictionOrder ArchivingOrder TaggingPublishing Order Delivery TrackingHoldsCreating and Updating OrderOrder Orchestration ProcessCart and Preview ModeOrder Orchestration ConfigurationOrder Cancellation &nbsp;
