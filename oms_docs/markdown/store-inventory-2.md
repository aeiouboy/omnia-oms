It is extremely crucial that at all times, there is visibility of the available inventory for effective allocation. It includes all inventory in the distribution centers as well as&nbsp;the stores. Inventory could further be classified as on-hand inventory and future inventory.&nbsp; Allocation will allocate&nbsp;the DC inventory&nbsp;to the stores by considering the store needs and inventory available at the stores. When inventory is allocated to stores, the inventory gets reserved for respective stores at the DC against the store order so that it is not available for other orders. Once DC ships&nbsp;the inventory as per the order, the available inventory and inventory reservation is reconciled. Store Inventory Store Inventory can&nbsp;be of two types: On Hand Inventory :&nbsp;It is the store inventory that represents the quantity at a store that is available and not yet allocated to a customer order. On Order Inventory:&nbsp;On order quantity represents all quantities in-transit&nbsp;to the store destination location that are not yet allocated to a customer order. &nbsp; Process Flow &nbsp; High Level Process Flow &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supply Updates The inventory system will get a notification about a supply change when the store inventory changes or when a new store PO is interfaced. The inventory system will then process the supply update&nbsp;and communicate&nbsp;it further to the allocation system. Store Inventory Supply Update Event POST-{{url}}/inventory/api/inventory/supply/supplyEvent { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;SupplyEvent&quot;: [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;TransactionTypeId&quot;: &quot;Adjustment&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LastTransDate&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;SupplyDefinition&quot;: { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ItemId&quot;: &quot;Crusset-Womens&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LocationId&quot;: &quot;Atlanta-Store&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;SupplyType&quot;: {&quot;SupplyTypeId&quot;: &quot;On Hand Available&quot;}, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;SupplyData&quot;: { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;UOM&quot;: &quot;EA&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Quantity&quot;: &quot;90&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;QuantityAdjustmentType&quot;: &quot;A&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] } &nbsp; Processing Eligible Supplies On receiving the notification, the allocation system will process the supply update in three ways: Run Allocation Overstock computation Stock status computation Note: Run allocation is triggered when real time allocation is configured. Allocation&nbsp;run is triggered when there is an update to Store On-Hand.&nbsp;It is not triggered on Store On-order update. Run Allocation&nbsp; On receiving the notification, the allocation system will evaluate which DC supplies are eligible for allocation. Allocation will process these supplies and calculate the suggested allocated quantity (RAQ) based on the store inventory and store needs. Allocators and Supervisors will then review and&nbsp;submit and approve the store allocations respectively. On release of the allocation order, we will see the store allocated quantity as on-order inventory for the respective store. Sample Example : &nbsp; DC Supply Store Need Store On-Hand Store On-Order Suggested Allocated Quantity (RAQ) 200 (100 Units On-Hand After Allocation) 100 20 10 70 (70 units as On-order Inventory for the store) &nbsp; Note : Details of DC Supply eligibility and processing are available at&nbsp;https://SCPlanning.helpdocsonline.com/dc-inventory Overstock Computation Allocation will evaluate which&nbsp;stores have overstocked inventory based on the thresholds. The stores that&nbsp;have overstock inventory are eligible for store to store transfers to the stores that have deficit inventory.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Stockstatus Computation Allocation will evaluate in which&nbsp;stores the available inventory is below the out&nbsp;of&nbsp;stock threshold. These item-locations will be marked as &#39;Out of Stock&#39;. &nbsp; Sample Example : &nbsp; Inventory Position (Store 1) Out of Stock Point Item Store Out of Stock? 100 50 N 30 50 Y &nbsp; &nbsp; Pullback Process At the end of the lifecycle of items at respective stores, the inventory will be pulled back to the DCs from respective stores based on the user configuration. On pullback, the inventory at DCs and stores is updated in the inventory system and the same is notified to allocation. &nbsp; Configurations Overstock Computation:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Set Transfer Parameters in Allocation Policy for respective Allocation Strategy.
