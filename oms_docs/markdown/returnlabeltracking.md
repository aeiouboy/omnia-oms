All the quantities of all the return lines in the return order with isReceiptExpected=true will be automatically moved to the carrier scanning status. The system will try to generate a return invoice for the return order based on the response from the third-party carriers. The system supports return label tracking for UPS, FedEx, and USPS out of the box. For more information on third-party carrier integration supported out of the base from order,&nbsp;refer to the&nbsp;Third Party Integrations&nbsp;guide. Process Flow Return Order Processing: Return Label Creation When a return label is created for a return order, the tracking number associated with the return label is submitted to the shipment component to track the return,&nbsp;and a tracking information record is created in the shipment tracking component to track the item through the parcel component. Once the return label is scanned at the carrier facility, and the status of the package moves to one of the statuses configured in the parcel status map corresponding to the substatus &quot;CarrierScanned&quot;, the shipment tracking component triggers the return order event for the &quot;carrier scanned&quot; event and all the quantities of the all the return lines with isReceiptExpected = true will be moved to carrier scanned status (14000) and the system will generate return invoice for the return order. The tracking information record created in the shipment component captures the below-mentioned attributes for tracking with open status. { &nbsp; &quot;CarrierCode&quot;: &quot;FDXE&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;ServiceLevelCode&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;TrackingNumber&quot;: &quot;795490437350&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;TrackingReferenceId&quot;: &quot;CC10000&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;TrackingType&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;TrackingTypeId&quot;: &quot;Return&quot; &nbsp; }, &nbsp; &quot;TrackingTypeConfigId&quot;: &quot;ReturnCarrierScannedConfig&quot; } Initiate Tracking Request Typically, the shipment component tracks the package status periodically from the time of creation of the tracking information record by initiating a track request through the parcel component to third-party carriers.&nbsp;The tracking process is controlled by the Tracking Type configured for the carrier (provider) and the service level code. Process Tracking Request (Carrier) The tracking request is converted based on the carrier and sent to a third-party carrier based on the Carrier Shipment configuration. Refer&nbsp;How to configure third party carrier integration&nbsp;to process the tracking request. Typically, the carrier sends tracking status&nbsp;as part of the tracking response. Process Tracking Response (Carrier) Tracking response from the third-party carrier is further processed by the parcel and shipment tracking components. This is done to reinitiate the tracking request (if the package is not yet scanned)&nbsp;based on the Tracking Type Configuration. Tracking Status -&nbsp;Third-Party carrier tracking status can be internally mapped to the retailer-specific status using Parcel Status Mapping. The parcel tracking activity code is mapped to Parcel - Status Sub Type. Refer&nbsp;How to change the Carrier tracking status to Retailers&nbsp;specific status&nbsp;for more details. On receiving the response from the parcel component, the current status of the package is recorded on the tracking information in the&nbsp;event status attribute and the details are also recorded in the tracking event. Once the event status becomes &quot;CarrierScanned&quot; and the status of the tracking information is set to closed, tracking of the return label stops. &nbsp;The event configured in the&nbsp;Tracking Type Configuration, which in the return tracking,&nbsp;is the return order event for the &quot;CarrierScanned&quot; event type. Configurations Tracking Type Configuration Use this configuration to configure the return tracking schedule for a Carrier,&nbsp;Service Level Code, and Tracking Type API: POST&nbsp;{{url}}/shipmenttracking/api/shipmenttracking/trackingTypeConfig/save { &nbsp; &quot;TrackingTypeConfigId&quot;: &quot;ReturnCarrierScannedConfig&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;TrackingType&quot;: &quot;Return&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;CarrierCode&quot;: &quot;FDXG&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;ServiceLevelCode&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;TrackTillEventStatus&quot;: &quot;CarrierScanned&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;TrackTillDays&quot;: 1, &nbsp; &quot;InitialDelayTime&quot;: 10, &nbsp; &quot;Frequency&quot;: 10, &nbsp; &quot;EventName&quot;: &quot;Shipmenttracking:Shipmenttracking:Event:ReturnOrderEvent&quot; } Use the below-mentioned configuration for publishing the event to order component on a particular carrier substatus mapped in parcel status map configuration API: POST&nbsp;{{url}}/shipmenttracking/api/shipmenttracking/trackingPublishConfig/import { &nbsp; &quot;data&quot;: [ &nbsp; &nbsp; { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;EventStatus&quot;: &quot;CarrierScanned&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Publish&quot;: true &nbsp; &nbsp; } &nbsp; ] } &nbsp; How to Configure Third-party Carrier Integration Configuration Details Credentials for Tracking APIs Use the Carrier Facility Accounts UI or the below API to upload carrier accounts to be integrated&nbsp;with each third-party. Each account should have a null facilityCode, as the facilityCode is used for SIF, but a single account with a null facilityCode must be configured for delivery tracking in order. The below sample json can be used for testing, but these credentials should not be used in production; contact your customer to get their UPS, FedEx, and USPS account information. POST /parcel/api/parcel/facilityAccount/import Configure a carrier This can be done in the Carrier UI or using the&nbsp;API (/parcel/api/parcel/carrier/save). Configuring carrier status mapping Add entries in the Carrier Status Mapping UI or API (/parcel/api/parcel/statusMap/import). An entry should be configured for each of the mappings from the third-party carrier status to the internal statuses of either &#39;InTransit&#39; or &#39;Delivered&#39;. &nbsp; How to Map Carrier Tracking Code Every third-party carrier uses their own status codes to track packages. Few status codes seed data exists out of the box for FedEx, UPS, and USPS. If additional status codes must be mapped, then status codes must be translated to the equivalent StatusSubType&nbsp;- &ldquo;CarrierScanned&rdquo; understood by Active&nbsp;Omni. New status code can be added or existing status code can be modified using the below API Carrier Scanned Parcel Status Map{ &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;data&quot;: [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Provider&quot;: &quot;UPS&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Code&quot;: &quot;P&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Description&quot;: &quot;Pickup Scan&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Status&quot;: &quot;InTransit&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;StatusDescription&quot; : &quot;In Transit&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;StatusSubType&quot;: &quot;CarrierScanned&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;StatusSubTypeDescription&quot; : &quot;CarrierScanned&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Status&quot;: &quot;InTransit&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Description&quot;: &quot;InTransit&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Code&quot;: &quot;PU&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Provider&quot;: &quot;FedEx&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;StatusDescription&quot;: &quot;InTransit&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;StatusSubType&quot;: &quot;CarrierScanned&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;StatusSubTypeDescription&quot; : &quot;CarrierScanned&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} &nbsp; &nbsp; ] } Implementation Flavors How to track return labels for carriers other than UPS, FedEx, USPS If return label tracking needs to be enabled by carriers other than UPS, FedEx, or USPS,&nbsp;follow the steps by: Build integration with the third party&#39;s tracking API using MACC components by working with services. Configure a carrier in the Carrier UI or API (/parcel/api/parcel/carrier/save). Add carrier facility accounts using the Carrier Facility Accounts UI or API referenced above. Provide valid credentials for connecting with the third party. Add entries in the Carrier Status Mapping UI or API (/parcel/api/parcel/statusMap/import). An entry should be configured for each of the mappings from the third-party carrier status code to the internal StatusSubType of &lsquo;CarrierScanned&rsquo;. How to map the carrier tracking code to Custom Status in Parcel Each third-party carrier uses their own status codes to track packages. These status codes must be translated into a common status understood by Active&nbsp;Omni, which is what the carrier status map entity does.&nbsp;To add status codes, upload the&nbsp;json&nbsp;to the API: Sample API to Add Status CodePOST /parcel/api/parcel/statusMap/import { &nbsp; &quot;data&quot;: [ &nbsp; { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Provider&quot;: &quot;FedEx&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Code&quot;: &quot;OD&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Description&quot;: &quot;Out of Delivery&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Status&quot;: &quot;InTransit&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;StatusDescription&quot; : &quot;In Transit&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;StatusSubType&quot;: &quot;OutForDelivery&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;StatusSubTypeDescription&quot; : &quot;Out for Delivery&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; } ] } Troubleshooting To troubleshoot any issues, Navigate to Menu&nbsp;option -&gt;&nbsp;Troubleshoot -&gt; Shipmenttracking -&gt; Return Shipment Tracking Select the query to represent the issue Enter the&nbsp;ReturnTrackingNumber and click Analyse.
