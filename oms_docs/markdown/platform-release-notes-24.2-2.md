A prompt will now appear that displays the Extension Handler Coverage, Route Coverage, Latency and Average Request Counts calculated for the extension pack. From here, the user can cancel and make changes to the extension pack or proceed with the download. &nbsp; &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Extension Pack Dependency Visibility The Manage Deployment screen now provides visibility of the extension packs that are dependent on the extension pack being managed. Users can view which extension packs will be affected if the existing extension pack is toggled off. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is controlled by permissions. &nbsp; Related: Manage Extension Pack Deployment &nbsp; Extensions Dashboard A new metrics tab has been added to the Extensions Dashboard. Each metric represents a count related to the extension packs that have been built, such as In Progress or Deployed extension packs, user exits and events defined, etc. &nbsp; &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Extensions Dashboard &nbsp; Extension Details - Route Details The Route Details displayed on the details tab of the Extension Details page now displays the route information for the past 24 hours. In addition, the charts are now both displayed to the user on a single page to allow for ease of viewing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Extensions Dashboard &nbsp; Extension Pack Enhancements &nbsp; Extension Pack List Page Filter Enhancements Two new filters have been added to the extension pack list page which allow the user to filter by Created Date and Last Updated Date. These fields can also be viewed on the results card, allowing the user to further narrow down the results by date. In addition to filtering by date, the Extension Type filter has been added which allows the results to be filtered by extension types such as database, user exit, events, etc. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Assign Labels Action Extension Packs now support the addition of custom labels via a new Assign Labels action. Upon selecting the action, the user can specify one to many custom labels which can be used to identify extension packs via a new filter added to the extension pack list page. Existing extension types that apply to the selected extension pack will be visible to the user via the Assign Labels screen in a read-only mode. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Extension Pack Builder Extension Pack Details &nbsp; An Extension Pack Details section has been added to each page of the extension pack builder. This new section will inform the user of the extension types configured in the extension pack along with pack information such as name, description, status and ersion. The details can be expanded and collapsed to meet the end user&#39;s needs. &nbsp; &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Extension Pack Details When viewing an extension pack,&nbsp;the profile list displayed on the extension pack details page will now only display profiles assigned to the extension pack. Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; File Extensions The voice-labels resource bundle is now available for Localization File Extensions. Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Framework Enhancements &nbsp; Enhanced Job Scheduling for Inactive Profiles The job scheduling capabilities within the Manhattan Active Platform now offer more streamlined functionality, even when handling inactive profiles. Previously, updating job schedules for inactive profiles could sometimes lead to errors. We&#39;ve addressed this with improved error handling &ndash; your job schedule updates (create, read, update, delete) will now be saved successfully, even if associated organizations haven&#39;t been fully set up yet. This provides a smoother configuration experience and eliminates unnecessary delays when working with inactive profiles. Note: When a previously inactive profile becomes active, there may be a delay of up to 24 hours before the configured job schedules start running. This delay is needed for the system to synchronize the updated schedules. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Expanded Date Formats for Nextup Numbers We&#39;ve added more flexibility when generating Nextup numbers. We&#39;ve introduced two new date formats to the options for your sequences: YMMDD: Year, Month, Day (e.g., 240331 for March 31st, 2024) YYMMDD: Two-digit Year, Month, Day (e.g., 240331 for March 31st, 2024) These new formats give you additional choices when customizing sequences to fit your tracking and identification needs. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; &nbsp;
