It consists of information about items and locations managed by the supply chain management system. This type of data is non-transient, non-transactional, and generally static. Users input this data from their host systems once, and it is purged according to business needs. Key Master Data in Supply Chain Planning Item Item represent the physical goods stored in the warehouse. The item entity stores essential attributes related to the products being sold. These attributes are used across all modules of the SCP application, including demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and allocation. Items can be configured via import and viewed via the Items UI. The item entity stores essential attributes related to the items being sold, like brand, size, color. The item from the softline categories (fashion) can be created at Style or Style/Color (size) level.  Assortment in fashion categories is driven by seasons like Spring-Summer,  and Autumn-Winter. The item styles are decided based on the season's preferences. Items from groceries and hardline categories (electronics) are only created at the item level. Key Item AttributesThe following are the key item attributes: Average purchase price Item hierarchy categories Description Size Category Eligibility flags for fulfillment options “pickup in store” and “ship to address” Key Attributes & Entities Base Attributes Base attributes are are attributes that are common to most of the items. There attributes are used to classify and search for items. Examples of Base Attributes: Season, style, color, size, brand etc Extended Attributes These attributes are implementation specific and these may not be as common as the base item attributes. Users will interface these values as per the implementation. Examples of Base Attributes: Screen size, EAN etc Planning Type This attribute will determine whether the item is an allocatable or replinishable item. Accordingly, the system will compute the suggested allocated quanity or suggested order quanity. Size Categories Size Categories is a pre-configured set of sizes applicable for the respective items. Size categories, when attached to an item, will establish a list of all possible sizes for that Item. Item Categories Item categories are used to form a logical grouping of items with common characteristics. Example categories include Women's Apparel, Men's Outerwear, Women's Accessories, etc. A category hierarchy can be defined if parent-child relationships exist between categories. Item categories inherit attributes from the parent category. Item categories can be configured via import or the Item Categories UI. Item Hierarchy Item hierarchies help classify items based on certain attributes to create Item Categories. These attributes can then be used to define business rules to manage allocations. Each level of the item hierarchy represents a category of items identified by attributes. Within a category, the same business rules can be applied to allocate items. For example : Men's Formal wear Shirts Item hierarchy helps to assign item-locations to policies for the following configurations: Item location grades Item location phases Item location constraints Allocator Assignments Allocation Strategies Item Access Filters Size Profiles Unit Of Measure Unit of measure, is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity. In SCP, units of measure are pre-defined based on current SI standards which includes: Weight : Measurement of the mass of Items. Example: KG, Ounce, Pound etc Volume : Measure of the volume occupied by Items measured in cubic units. Example :CuIn, CuFt, CuDm etc Currency : A unit of measurement that applies to monetary value in financial transactions. Example: Dollar, Euro etc Packaging: the unit that any given item can be packaged into. Example: Each, Case, Pallet etc Locations Location is a physical or virtual entity where information exchange occurs, or physical goods are stored. Locations could be a variety of entities such as stores, Warehouses, Distribution Centers, Suppliers, and Demand channels. A source Location refers to a specific place or entity from which goods or resources originate. A destination Location refers to a specific place or entity that receives goods, materials, or services. Key Location AttributesFollowing are the key attributes assigned to locations: Region Climate (Hot, Cold, Tropical) Store Size (Small, large) Primary DC Activation Date Deactivation Date Channel (Retail, E-Commerce) Key Attributes & Entities Location Groups Locations are typically grouped by retailers using attributes such as climate, store, and size. Location groups are used in SCP for the purpose of grouping locations and set business rules for the location groups for replenishing or allocating inventory. Location Priority Schedule Helps to prioritize the locations with a higher margin. Channels Channels are the mediums for a retailer to sell their inventory. Channels can be used to define allocations of inventory for sectors of the business other than a store. For example, e-commerce orders, wholesale business, etc. Channel locations may (stores) or may not maintain physical inventory levels (E-comm) but allow MAA to represent a virtual location, where need is calculated using real sales or plans, to submit allocations for these channels. Item Locations Item Location represents an item stocked at a physical location such as DC or store etc An Item-Location serves as the lowest level in the inventory management system where forecasting, stock status, and logistical information are maintained. Distribution Orders in SCP are at the “item-location” level. Many attributes may be specific to an item location rather than at the item level. Key Attributes & Entities Item Location Phases Item location phases define periods of time for a given group of item locations; in these phases, MAA will employ a specific need computation method for these item locations. Fashion items follow different stages in their lifecycle. Pre-season: When the item-location is active and ready to receive inventory allocations. In-season: When the item-location is ready for sale the inventory for the respective season. End of season: When the season at an item-location is over and the item is no longer allocated to a location. Item Location Grades Item location grades serve as a ranking method for an item location. Grades are assigned for destination locations at an item hierarchy (category) level. When allocating a finite supply, MAA can use item location grades to determine which store will receive the inventory first. For example, if an item has an A grade at store X and a B grade at store Y, store X would receive inventory before MAA would allocate it to store Y. Item Location Constraints Item location constraint is a collective name for minimum and maximum in MAA. Constraints can be applied to item locations or at higher levels in the item hierarchy. On the location side, they must be created at the store or channel level. These mins and maxes in MAA will represent store constraints. Maximum values are usually driven by shelf space requirements, while minimum values are driven by display minimums so that certain items in the store don’t appear to be lean or out of stock on the shelves. When allocating inventory to fulfill an item location’s need in MAA, the system will consider these constraints and limits the need calculations appropriately. If MAA calculates a need that is greater than the maximum, MAA will replace that value with the maximum. Similarly, if MAA calculates a need that is less than the minimum, MAA will replace that need with the minimum. Business Calendar A business calendar is a calendar used for business processes and supply chain planning in retail. This helps in aligning the selling seasons with respective quarters, months, and weeks in a business year. Typical business calendars in fashion retail are defined as 4-5-4, 5-4-4, and 4-4-5 calendars, where the numbers indicate weeks in each month in a quarter of a business year. This is used for defining comparable weeks in each quarter to evaluate business performance month over month and quarter over quarter. The Business Calendar helps with organizing time periods (or weeks). This may start on any day of the year and can run for any length of time. This stores the current date associated with that calendar. Sourcing Relationship The "Sourcing Relationship" defines the connection between two locations in terms of which is a source and which is a destination for replenishing or allocating inventory. A sourcing relationship could be from Vendor to DC or DC to store based on the requirement. Some key supply chain parameters like the Lead time, Order Cycle , Review frequency etc are configured for sourcing relationship. Item Location Source An Item Location Source refers to the specific source location from which items are procured or sourced for delivery to a designated destination location. An Item Location Source is a predefined source location within the supply chain network from which items are sourced for distribution or consumption. An item location source could be DC or a Vendor. Attribute Inheritance Attribute Inheritance describes how lower-level entities in SCP inherit parameter settings from higher-level entities. SCP uses an inheritance hierarchy to determine how the parameter settings are maintained and flow from the higher levels to the lower levels.
