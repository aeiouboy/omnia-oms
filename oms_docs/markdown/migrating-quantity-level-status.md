These orders will utilize the Web and Call Center order types that will be used for new orders created in Active Omni and will follow the associated order configurations. Orders will be migrated with invoices (in a closed status) that correspond to completed settlements and refunds on the order. How to Migrate Quantity-Level Status The quantity detail entity in Active Omni (AO) represents the quantity in each unique status. Since there is no equivalent object in Pre-Active/Legacy which tracks quantity-level status, the translation layer must derive the quantity status by looking at the following entities in the Pre-Active/Legacy order: Order line quantity Order line cancelled quantity Distribution order line quantity LPN detail quantity Rules for Migration All units should be in Open, Fulfilled, or Cancelled status prior to migration. No units should be in Allocated, Released, etc. See below for 2013 status mappings. If allocations and release objects are included, then corresponding quantity details (in status 2000 and 3000, respectively) should be included with 0 quantity. If any quantity detail is included, all quantities on the line must be included in quantity details. For example, if a partially shipped line has 1 unit shipped and 2 units back ordered, the line must be imported with 2 quantity details: 1 unit in 7000, 2 units in 1500. If no quantity detail is included on the order line, then all quantity is assumed to be in open status. If some quantity on the order line is fulfilled, then quantity details must be included for all quantities on the line. For example, if 3 units are ordered and 3 units are open, then the line can be saved with no quantity details, as they are assumed to be in open status. If 3 units are ordered and 1 unit is fulfilled, then the line must be saved with a 'fulfilled' quantity detail with 1 unit, and an 'open' quantity detail with 2 units. The fulfillment detail entity is required for customer order shipments (just like the LPN in 2013), as it's used for invoicing and tracking packages. The fulfillment detail entity is not required for sales orders, unless the retailer wants to save data about parcel shipments. Active Omni order and line fulfillment status, min fulfillment status, and max fulfillment status are calculated by the system based on quantity details and do not need to be passed in the order import. Only quantity details are required; in some cases, no quantity details are required if all units are in open status. To ensure returnable quantity is decremented on the parent order when return orders are migrated, parent orders should be migrated before return orders. For example, if a customer order with 4 shipped units has a return of 2 units, then the customer's order needs to be saved in Active Omni order when the return is created, so that the customer order line returnable quantity gets decremented from 4 to 2. Status Mapping Pre-Active/Legacy Support Active Status Active Entities Required Sourced (200) Scheduling Failed (390) Allocation Failed (490) Created (20) Open (1000) Order Line Shipped (850) Fulfilled (7000) Order Line Quantity Detail Allocation (line level; one per allocation) Release (header level; one per DO) Fulfillment Detail (line level; one per order line, per package) Canceled (940) Canceled (9000) Order Line Note: The system will not maintain quantity detail status 9000 for cancelled quantity on order lines during migration,.The cancelled quantity is updated in OrderLineCancelHistory. Examples Customer Order Examples The below examples show how to translate orders in different statuses to Active.
