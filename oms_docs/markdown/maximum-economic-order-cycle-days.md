This functionality&nbsp;provides greater control over order cycle calculations by allowing users to set a cap at both the Location and Item Inheritance Policy levels. If a value is set at the Location or Item Inheritance Policy level based on the Inheritance Hierarchy, the system applies the threshold at the Item Location Analysis Details level, ensuring that the Economic Order Cycle does not exceed the specified limit. The Economic Order Cycle is the optimal order cycle that balances acquisition and carrying costs to determine the most cost-effective ordering frequency for an item. It considers two key cost inputs: Carrying Cost and Line Cost. Orders should only be placed when necessary to maintain efficiency and cost-effectiveness.&nbsp; &nbsp; Example: Forecast/week = 70, Joint Order Cycle = 1, Economic Order Cycle = 5, Review Order Cycle = 2 Maximum Economic Order Cycle Days = 3 &rarr; Economic Order Cycle = 3 Greater of (Joint Order Cycle = 1, Economic Order Cycle = 3, Review Order Cycle = 2) Order up to Level Safety Stok&nbsp; + 30 3 Lead Time + 70 7 Economic Order Cycle + 30 3 Order Up to Level Total = 130 13 &nbsp; Process Flow Configurations How to Configure Maximum Economic Order Cycle Days in the Item Inheritance Policy? &nbsp; Item Inheritance Policy{{url}}/item/api/item/itemInheritancePolicy/save { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ItemInheritancePolicyId&quot;: &quot;ItemInheritancePolicyId1&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;PolicyRank&quot;: 1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;PlanningAttributePolicy&quot;: { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;MaximumEconomicOrderCycleDays&quot;: 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } } &nbsp; How to Configure&nbsp;Maximum Economic Order Cycle Days in the Location Inheritance Policy? &nbsp; Location Inheritance Policy{{url}}/itemlocation/api/itemlocation/locationInheritancePolicy/save { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LocationInheritancePolicyId&quot;: &quot;LocationInheritancePolicyId1&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Description&quot;: &quot;LocationInheritancePolicyId1&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;PolicyRank&quot;: 2, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;MaximumEconomicOrderCycleDays&quot;: 10 } &nbsp; To view the capped Maximum Economic Order Cycle Days&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Item Location Analysis Details? &nbsp; E Order Cycle - Item Location Analysis Details {{url}}/itemlocation/api/itemlocation/itemlocation/itemLocationFactors/ { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;SourceLocationId&quot;: &quot;DC1&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LocationId&quot;: &quot;Store2&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;SubGroup&quot;: &quot;Frozen&quot; } &nbsp; Uls and Entities &nbsp; UI Name Component Seed Data Present?
