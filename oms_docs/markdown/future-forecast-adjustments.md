Accessing the Forecast Adjustments Panel Click on the pencil icon in the data grid to open the Forecast Projections tab. This panel allows users to manually adjust forecasts, freeze forecasts, or seed forecasts for any future period. Editable and Non-Editable Rows Future data rows are editable. Current and past data rows are non-editable: Past data rows will have the pencil icon disabled (gray). Editable rows will have the pencil icon enabled (black). Manual Changes and Indicators Rows with manual changes or freeze forecasts will display a red dot on the pencil icon. The currently selected row will show a blue-colored pencil icon. Forecast Adjustments Tab Actions Users can: Manually adjust forecasts. Freeze forecast values. View Planned Demand Quantity and Total Forecast values. Saving Changes Save updates to process changes, refresh, and reload the data on the UI. If the Seasonalized Forecast is modified, subsequent weeks&#39; projections may also change. If a Freeze Forecast End Date is entered without modifying the Seasonalized Forecast, the forecast values in the left main panel will not change until that future period arrives. After saving, the Forecast Adjustments panel closes, and a success toast message is displayed. Canceling Changes Canceling reverts all unsaved changes and closes the panel without applying updates. Removing Changes The Remove button deletes manual and freeze forecasts, triggering the synchronization process. The Remove button is enabled only if a manual change record exists for the period. Manual Forecast Adjustments Users can modify a future period&#39;s Seasonalized Forecast, and the Total Forecast is immediately recalculated. Freeze Forecast Users can freeze a forecast value for a future period. The system validates the Freeze End Date to ensure it is set in the future. Planned Demand Users can review the Total Planned Demand Adjustment, which is calculated by the system. &nbsp; Note:&nbsp;The current period&#39;s seasonalized forecast, along with other relevant information, can be modified from the same UI under the General tab. However, changing forecast information for any past period&nbsp;is not supported from the UI. &nbsp; &nbsp;
