Replenishment Lead Time Forecasting Introducing the Lead Time Forecast (LTF) feature, designed to significantly enhance supply chain visibility and planning accuracy. This new capability automatically calculates lead times for each SKU based on actual historical order receipt data, enabling smarter inventory optimization, replenishment planning, and order management. The feature offers flexible configuration options across various levels (global, location inheritance, sourcing relationship, order) and includes the ability to update or override the calculated lead time accessible through a dedicated UI. &nbsp; Enablement:This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Lead Time Forecasting &nbsp; PO/ASN ETA-based Order Projections This release introduces enhanced inventory forecasting capabilities by incorporating expected delivery dates (ETAs) from purchase orders (POs) and advance ship notices (ASNs) into the system's planning engine. Previously, future inventory projections were based largely on static inventory levels, which could result in inaccurate forecasting and suboptimal planning decisions. With this update, the system now uses detailed and accurate inbound supply data to provide a clearer view of future stock availability. This enhancement enables businesses to make smarter purchasing decisions, reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory, improve customer satisfaction by providing accurate product availability timelines, and refine replenishment planning through better visibility of incoming supplies. Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related:&nbsp; PO/ASN ETA-based Order Projections &nbsp; Inheritance - Boolean Attributes (nullable) - UI Changes The system now supports inheritance of boolean attributes across both the Location and Item hierarchies, simplifying the management of shared configurations and ensuring consistency across all levels. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Adjust delay based on manual minimums configured for Item-Locations The application now includes a new configuration (adjDelayMin)&nbsp;that modifies delay computation to factor in the manual minimum. This means service checks can be triggered when the manual minimum is at risk, rather than waiting until inventory is nearly depleted. Enabling this option may lead to more orders with "zero delay" and an increase in service check exceptions. By default, this configuration is set to 'false'. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Inventory Optimization Item Relationship - Substitution The Substitution feature in ASCP introduces the ability to configure temporary item replacements between SKUs using the existing Item Relationship framework. Unlike Supercession, which supports permanent replacements, Substitution handles short-term or promotional replacements with clear start and end dates. The feature allows users to configure attributes such as end date, forward sales accumulation, inventory and committed quantity accumulation, and life cycle policy transitions for both the original and substitute SKUs. Users can define if history and stock status should be carried forward from the substitute to the original item and whether to revert these after deactivation. The UI enhancements include separate screens for defining, activating, and deactivating substitution relationships, with validations to ensure logical date sequences. Deactivation can be triggered by business rules like a specified end date, with optional forecast initialization and lifecycle changes. Substitution relationships and their status are now visible across multiple UI areas, improving planning visibility and accuracy during transitional SKU phases. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Item Relationship &nbsp; Batch Change Framework The application has been enhanced with a Batch Update feature that allows users to efficiently update multiple data elements with minimal manual effort. This is particularly useful when users need to update a common field for many records. These changes are processed as background tasks, enabling users to continue working while the system completes the updates. In 25.3, Batch Change has been adopted for the Item Location UI. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related:&nbsp; Batch Update &nbsp; Including Item Location Source's Purchasing UOM UOM for Orders and Inventories The application has been enhanced with two new attributes: Purchasing Quantity and Purchasing Quantity UOM, now available on the Order Line screen. The system will automatically convert order quantities based on the configured Purchasing Quantity UOM and display them accordingly. Note: The Purchasing Quantity UOM must be configured in either Global Config UOMs, or Order Display UOMs, or Base UOMs. Only then will the system perform quantity calculations using the Purchasing UOM. Additionally, the ratio to base must be defined for all UOMs at the item-location level. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Review Date Exception The application has been enhanced with a new step, 'Review Schedule Override,' in the Sourcing Relationship Create and Edit screen. This step appears after 'Review Schedule Configuration' and allows users to set up the review schedule override. It is also visible in the Detail view as well. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Add Descriptions to UI Screens The attributes Source Location Name, Location Name, and Item Description have been newly introduced across the following screens: Suggested Order Details, Item Location Analysis List, Item Location Analysis Details, Item Location, and Sourcing Relationship. Attribute Enhancements Across Screens: Suggested Order Details (Header): Source Location Name, Location Name Suggested Order Details – Lines Tab: Item Description- user can apply the filter with this attribute Item Location Analysis: Source Location Name, Location Name, Item Description Item Location Analysis Details: Source Location Name, Location Name, Item Description Item Location – Description: Users can interface Item, Location, or Item-Location descriptions. This is an editable field available on the Item Location Edit screen. Sourcing Relationship – Description: Users can interface Location, Source Location, or Location-Source Location descriptions. This is also an editable field on the Sourcing Relationship Edit screen. Note&nbsp;- Once the feature is enabled, these attributes will be populated only after the order recalculation or order build process has been completed and, currently, any further updates to the description fields in the master data will not be reflected in these attributes by the system. These attributes do not reflect updated values if modified a second time. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Demand Forecasting Aggregate Seasonal Profiling Earlier releases introduced the Aggregated Seasonal Profile feature, which improved forecast accuracy by capturing seasonal patterns at higher levels of the item and location hierarchy. Expanding on this, the current release delivers comprehensive aggregate seasonal profiling. This enhancement enables the creation of seasonal profiles across various hierarchy levels through the submission of an aggregate seasonal profile policy. To facilitate this, new entities have been added to store item and location hierarchy attributes. This information is then processed by the system, which aggregates historical demand data to generate seasonal profiles at the specified aggregated level, further boosting forecast accuracy—especially in cases where item-level data is sparse or inconsistent. Additionally, a new user interface allows users to directly manage and fine-tune seasonal profiles, improving efficiency and ease of maintenance. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Aggregated Seasonal Profiling &nbsp; Day of Week Profile The Day of Week (DOW) Profiling feature in SCP introduces the ability to disaggregate weekly forecasts into daily values based on historical demand patterns by weekday. This enhancement allows the creation of DOW policies and location-specific default profiles that define how item-location combinations should be profiled. These profiles enable forecast entities to reflect typical weekday demand behavior—for example, higher weekend demand for certain perishable goods. The system automatically applies the appropriate DOW profiles during forecast calculations, improving daily forecast granularity and enabling more accurate estimation of lost sales when inventory falls below the out-of-stock threshold. Users can assign DOW profiles through forecast policies or directly on forecast records. Dedicated user interfaces have been added for managing both policies and profiles. Overall, this feature significantly improves forecast accuracy and supply planning effectiveness, especially for items with pronounced weekly sales patterns. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Day of Week Profile &nbsp; Personalization Enhancements Personalization capabilities on Suggested Order Details and Item Location Analysis Suggested Order Details screens can be personalized for the following details and saved as a view.
