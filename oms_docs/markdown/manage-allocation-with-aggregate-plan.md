The aggregate plan enables the ability to track actual allocations released till date&nbsp;and other related metrics, such as Sales, on-Hand, and Need&nbsp;at the same level as the aggregate plan. These metrics can be used to set up Auto Submit-Approval criteria and ensure allocations are aligned with the plan by stopping auto approval and notifying the user when allocations exceed plan. The aggregate plan can be modified to align with a revised business strategy, as needed. It displays a line of attributes for future supplies.&nbsp;Users can identify same items with different ids in same PO/ASN. &nbsp; Note:&nbsp; 1) The aggregate plan is&nbsp;applicable only for on-hand and not for PO and ASN. 2) Line Id will display only for future supplies(PO/ASN)&nbsp;and not for on-Hand.&nbsp; &nbsp; Process Flow Create New Plan Metric Type: Create a new plan metric type to track metrics related to the Aggregate Plan. Default value - Assortment_Plan Create New Plan Type: Create a new plan type and assign a metric type created for Aggregate Plan. Default value - Plan_Sales Define Plan&nbsp;Type and Plan Metric Type for Aggregate Allocation Metric:&nbsp;This configuration is used for the system to track metrics related to Aggregate Plan. Define Location Hierarchy for Aggregate Plan: Create Location Hierarchy for Aggregate Plan. This is an optional step. &nbsp;A secondary location hierarchy of up to three levels can be set up for an Aggregate plan (Example - Channel-Region-Location Id OR Region-District&nbsp; OR District&nbsp;) Configure Location Hierarchy: Assign Location Hierarchy to be used for Aggregate Plan. Configure Location Hierarchy Level: Assign Location Hierarchy Level for Aggregate Plan. Example - If the Location Hierarchy assigned to the Aggregate Plan is Channel-Region and the Aggregate Plan is set up by Region, then the Location Hierarchy Level value needs to be set up as &#39;Region&#39;. The system will track the following metrics for the Aggregate Plan. Allocation Quantity Released Till Date Sales Final Allocation Quantity Need at destination locations On Hand at destination locations On Order for destination locations Remaining Plan Quantity (To be Released) = Adjusted Value - Released Till Date Quantity - Final Allocation Quantity Remaining Plan Quantity (Required at Stores) = Adjusted Value - Sales - On Hand - On Orders - Final Allocation Quantity The system will track the above metrics related to Aggregate Plan at a configured location hierarchy level and all levels above. In the above example, metrics will be aggregated at Region and Channel Level. Released Till Date Quantity is updated after a supply is released All other metrics are updated as part of&nbsp;Allocation process, which is triggered as a scheduled job or when a new supply is available, based on user configuration. Configure number of weeks to aggregate sales: The system&nbsp;will aggregate sales for as many prior weeks of sales available for a product based on this configuration. Example - If the number of weeks to aggregate sales is set to 52, then the system will aggregate sales for the prior 52 weeks. Create Aggregate Plan: Aggregate Plan values need to be at Item Id and at the level at Location Hierarchy Level is configured.&nbsp; Sample Aggregate Plan Entry Original Value - This value indicates the initial value for the aggregate plan. Adjusted Value - This value indicates a revised value for the aggregate plan.&nbsp; Aggregate Plan can be created using the &#39;Aggregate Plan&#39; UI Aggregate Plan can be edited in the following ways: Using data loader or manual entries &quot;Aggregate Plan &#39; UI. For more information refer to&nbsp; &#39;Aggregate Plan&#39; Using &#39;Edit Aggregate Plan&#39; icon&nbsp;on &#39;Allocation Maintenance&#39; UI. Metrics related to Aggregate Plan can be used as Auto Submit-Approval criteria. Auto Submit-Approval criteria is checked when Allocation engine runs to allocate new supplies. Pre-requisite - Allocation Assignment and Auto Submit-Approval criteria should be set up. Using Aggregate Plan as Auto Submit-Approval criteria. Example below -&nbsp; Set up Allocator Assignment Set up Auto Submit-Approval criteria If the Auto Submit-Approval criteria is not met, the user will see a notification on the supply tile on Allocated Supplies UI with information about the policy and criteria. If the Auto Submit-Approval criteria is met, the supply will be processed without notification and moved to the next status. Currently, Aggregate Plan&nbsp;are only tracked for &#39;On Hand&#39; Supply Type. Future supply types, &#39;PO&#39; and &quot;ASN&#39; are excluded. Configurations Configuration -&nbsp;Define Plan Type and Plan Metric Type for Aggregate Allocation Metric { &quot;ConfigValue&quot;: &quot;AssortmentPlan:Plan_Sales&quot;, &quot;ConfigId&quot;: &quot;AggregateAllocationMetricPlanTypeMetricTypeId&quot; } &nbsp; How to Define Location Hierarchy&nbsp;- Refer to Location Hierarchy Configuration for Location Hierarchy and Level for Aggregate Plan { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ConfigId&quot;: &quot;AggregatePlanMetricLocationHierarchyId&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ConfigValue&quot;: &quot;Primary&quot; } { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ConfigId&quot;: &quot;AggregatePlanMetricLocationHierarchyLevel, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ConfigValue&quot;: &rdquo;Region&quot; } &nbsp; Configuration for Number of Weeks to Aggregate { &quot;ConfigId&quot;: &quot;NumberOfWeekToAggregateSales&quot;, &quot;ConfigValue&quot;: &quot;52&quot; } &nbsp; Implementation Flavors NA &nbsp; Troubleshooting If Location Hierarchy Level is not visible while editing or creating Aggregate Plan UI, please check if &#39;Location Hierarchy&#39; and &#39;Location Hierarchy Level&#39; has been configured. If Auto Submit-Approval criteria has been created but Auto Submit-Approval flow is not working as expected, please check Auto Submit-Approval critieria.
