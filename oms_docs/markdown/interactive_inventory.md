This enables our customers to provide delivery dates on the product detail page, view cart and checkout for all service levels. This will eliminate the need to synchronize inventory updates to selling channels, thus reducing latency and improving accuracy. With Interactive Inventory, the Calculate Delivery Dates and Calculate Cart Delivery dates services aid in computing of the delivery dates for the Product Details Page and View Cart/Checkout pages respectively, for different service levels. These services leverage the new Availability Cache component for computing availability and delivery dates. &ldquo;Location Proximity&rdquo;, &ldquo;Handling Cost&rdquo; and &quot;Selling Price Differential&quot; are the three optimization factors that can be configured to provide an optimized delivery date. &nbsp;
