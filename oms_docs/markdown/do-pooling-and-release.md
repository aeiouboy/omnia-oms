The&nbsp;order policy also includes a few criteria for auto-releasing Orders into an API, such as setting the maximum number of order lines in an order, the minimum order quantity, the supply source type (e.g., on hand or future supplies). When the number of Order Lines is exceeded, MAA will generate a new order and attach the remaining Order Lines to this new Order. &nbsp; Configurations Order Policy configuration defines the criteria and distinct attributes for aggregating Order Lines into an Order.&nbsp; Below is a list of attributes that can be selected for aggregation: Source Location - required Destination Location - required Source Type (On-Hand, ASN, PO) Source Id (ASN Id or PO Id) Splitting orders by source type and source Id helps the distribution center with their order planning, i.e., when to release the orders to the floor.&nbsp; &nbsp; The order Policy also includes a few criteria for automatically generating JSON format API messages and auto-releasing orders into a queue: Minimum Oder Quantity &ndash; An order API will not be automatically generated and released until the minimum order quantity is met. Maximum Order Lines - When the number of order lines is exceeded, the system generates a new order and attaches the remaining order lines to the new order. When the minimum order quantity and the maximum order lines are in conflict, the maximum number of&nbsp;order lines criteria takes precedence over the minimum order quantity. Supply Source Type &ndash; The system will automatically generate and release orders for the selected supply source type(s) like&nbsp;On-hand, PO, or ASN.&nbsp; If one or more order details in the order includes one of the unselected. Release Horizon Days &ndash; Future supply days can be generated and released automatically when the source type is a PO or ASN. &nbsp; Process Flow &nbsp; &nbsp; Generating&nbsp;and Releasing an Order There are two scheduled jobs available for releasing an order: Order Release with Criteria - This job checks for the order policy criteria before generating and releasing an order.&nbsp; It can be scheduled once a day, every few hours, or as required.&nbsp; This job will release orders that meet&nbsp;all&nbsp;criteria.&nbsp; Order Sweep &ndash; This job releases all unreleased orders without checking any of the policy criteria. &nbsp;It can be scheduled to sweep&nbsp;all orders that are not released on a specific date and time. e.g., end of the day or end of the week.&nbsp; Typically, the order sweep scheduled job is scheduled less frequently than the previously mentioned Order Release with Criteria scheduled job.&nbsp; A user can also manually release an order from the Orders UI.&nbsp; Manual order release triggers the order sweep job to run, so the order policy criteria will not be considered.&nbsp; When an order is released, the system generates the order API in JSON format and publishes it into a pre-defined queue (e.g., ai-all-xin-orderToMAO queue), ready to be consumed by the Host or another system.&nbsp; The system also updates the internal order status to &ldquo;Released&rdquo; and updates the supply status to &ldquo;Released&rdquo; if all orders that are associated with the supply have been released, or to &ldquo;Partial Release&rdquo; if one or more order(s) that are associated with that supply have not been released.&nbsp; &nbsp; Supply Updates When an external system sends an API to update a supply in approved or partially released status, this supply update will be rejected, and an error message will be displayed on the corresponding supply card in the Allocated Supplies UI.&nbsp; A supply in approved or partially released status cannot be rolled back to unallocated status to ensure that all previously made decisions for suggesting, reviewing, submitting, and approving a supply and generating orders will not be overridden. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Once all orders that are associated with a supply have been released, the supply is deleted.&nbsp; Any new supply update for the same item, source, and supply type/Id will be accepted, and a new supply record will be created.&nbsp; &nbsp; Implementation Flavors Pull-back and store transfer orders are handled through separate processes.&nbsp; However, the order&nbsp;JSON format API for these orders is similar to a DC to store allocation order. &nbsp; Troubleshooting NA Related Articles Manage Allocation By Location CategoriesAllocation Submission and ApprovalManage Allocation with Aggregate PlanSubmit /Approval Team Configurations &nbsp;
