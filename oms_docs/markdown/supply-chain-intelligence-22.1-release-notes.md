Other Update: Custom Content Exchange&nbsp;Across SCI Environments SCI customers can create high volumes of custom reports daily for better visibility and decision-making. Managing these reports can be difficult when moved from development to production environments. To&nbsp;simplify this process, Manhattan Active&reg; SCI now has the feature that provides more flexibility for the customers to move custom content across non-production and production environments. Customers can work with the Manhattan&nbsp;Active&reg; Services Team to enable the import/export job for the Cognos environment. Once it is enabled, customers can manually trigger this job and facilitate the custom content exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;
