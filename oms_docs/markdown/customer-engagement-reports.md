OverviewFirst Call Resolution Rate By Week ReportPast Due Cases ReportCase Resolution By Assignee ReportCase Resolution Metrics ReportCase Detail ReportAgent Performance ReportMissed SLA By Interaction Type Overview The Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) use the Customer Engagement component to record the support issues raised by customers through different communication channels. Operational SCI of Manhattan Active Omni® includes Customer Engagement Reports that derive data from this component and enable retailers to analyze the overall case management of their products to resolve customer grievances. These reports include details of customer cases, such as case type, priority, case assignee, resolution time, past trends, etc. You can access the Customer Engagement reports in IBM Cognos by navigating to Team Content > SCI Packaged Content > Reports > OMNI > Customer Engagement. Common Prompts The following table summarizes some of the common prompts used in this report: Prompt Name Description Case Status The following statuses are included in this prompt: Closed: This status represents the resolved cases Draft: This status represents cases that are not addressed or closed by CSR InProgress: This status represents that the case resolution is in progress Open: This status represents that the case is opened and needs to be further worked upon Case Category While creating a case in MAO, the contact center agent can select a case category to provide more details on the ticket. This prompt contains a host of such case categories, such as Call Back Request, Cancellation, Credit/Debit Card, Damage/Defective, Email, Employee Issue, Gift Card/eGift Card, Gift Wrap/Gift Message, Membership, Order Assistance, Order Delay, Order Verification, etc. Case Assignee This prompt lists out the names of CSRs to whom cases are assigned. You must search for the last name of the assignee. Case Resolved Month This prompt allows users to select the month of case resolution. You must enter months in the following format: MMM YYYY Example: Jan 2023 Mar 2020 Jul 2019 The following sections provide details of reports under the Customer Engagement Reports header. First Call Resolution Rate By Week Report The purpose of this visualization is to identify how many calls are resolved in five mins or less. This is considered the 'first call resolution'. The report includes the Total Count of Cases Resolved to give context to the number of cases closed in five mins or less. Using this report, you can determine the efficiency and effectiveness of your CSR team in resolving open cases.

It includes internal filters to exclude closed cases, and to retrieve only records where the due date is past the current date. It returns the results in past due order, with the most tardy cases at the top. It includes the Case ID, the Priority, Due Date Time, Created Date Time, Hours Past Due, Case Status, Assignee, and the case type (phone, chat, email, social, store interaction, virtual assistant).

It includes filters based on the Case Resolution Month and the Assignee's last name. The report returns the employee’s first and last name, how many cases were assigned and closed for the filter month, the Closure Percent, Average Resolution Time and Total Resolution Time. It includes both a graphical chart (closure rate to assigned rate per employee) and the traditional chart.

Report Prompt Report Output Case Resolution Metrics Report This report summarizes resolved cases based on their Product Class, Item & Item Description. This is helpful when researching cases associated with a specific item or product class. The report includes Case Resolution Month, Case Category, and Product Class for filtering data.
