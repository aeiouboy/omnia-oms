Related: Extensions Dashboard Extension Pack Enhancements Extension Pack List Page Filter Enhancements Two new filters have been added to the extension pack list page which allow the user to filter by Created Date and Last Updated Date.

Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Assign Labels Action Extension Packs now support the addition of custom labels via a new Assign Labels action. Upon selecting the action, the user can specify one to many custom labels which can be used to identify extension packs via a new filter added to the extension pack list page. Existing extension types that apply to the selected extension pack will be visible to the user via the Assign Labels screen in a read-only mode. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Extension Pack Builder Extension Pack Details An Extension Pack Details section has been added to each page of the extension pack builder. This new section will inform the user of the extension types configured in the extension pack along with pack information such as name, description, status and version. The details can be expanded and collapsed to meet the end user's needs. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. UI Extensions The UI Extension page of the Extension Pack Builder now has support for customization of the Omni Desktop as seen below. Manhattan Active® Omni Enterprise enables you to maintain a robust set of business rules and configurations.

Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Framework Enhancements Enhanced Job Scheduling for Inactive Profiles The job scheduling capabilities within the Manhattan Active® Platform now offer more streamlined functionality, even when handling inactive profiles. Previously, updating job schedules for inactive profiles could sometimes lead to errors. We've addressed this with improved error handling – your job schedule updates (create, read, update, delete) will now be saved successfully, even if associated organizations haven't been fully set up yet. This provides a smoother configuration experience and eliminates unnecessary delays when working with inactive profiles. Note: When a previously inactive profile becomes active, there may be a delay of up to 24 hours before the configured job schedules start running. This delay is needed for the system to synchronize the updated schedules. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Expanded Date Formats for Nextup Numbers We have added more flexibility when generating Nextup numbers, and have introduced two new date formats to the options for your sequences: YMMDD: Year, Month, Day (e.g., 40331 for March 31st, 2024) YYMMDD: Two-digit Year, Month, Day (e.g., 240331 for March 31st, 2024) These new formats give you additional choices when customizing sequences to fit your tracking and identification needs. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Supply Chain Intelligence Manhattan Active® Supply Chain Intelligence version 24.2 comprises improvements to the existing Customer Engagement dashboards and reports. The following outlines some of the notable enhancements to Operational SCI for Manhattan Active® Omni in this release. Dashboard Enhancements Customer Engagement Dashboard The 24.2 release introduces significant enhancements to the Customer Engagement dashboard. Extensive modifications to filters, metrics, and visualizations deliver enhanced reporting capabilities and deeper insights. New visualizations, such as case count per case category, cases created and resolved per customer and priority type, help evaluate the effectiveness of your overall case management processes. This dashboard offers valuable information you can use to develop business strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize operational efficiency. It displays data for the past 30 days, allowing you to analyze and meet your business needs. Enablement: These features are automatically enabled as part of the release. Customer Engagement Scorecard The dashboard has undergone significant improvements in both filters and visual representations. Notable changes involve the introduction of additional visualizations, such as case resolution by priority and interaction type, cases with missed SLAs, reporting on cases resolved within five minutes of creation, and more. This dashboard focuses on assessing diverse customer interaction methods, including phone, chat, in-store, social media, virtual assistant, and text messages. Its primary purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of these interaction types in achieving successful case resolutions. Enablement: These features are automatically enabled as part of the release. Report Enhancements Customer Engagement Reports Numerous changes are made to five existing reports under the Customer Engagement header. The reports, namely Case Detail, Case Resolution by Assignee, Case Resolution by Metrics, First Call Resolution Rate by Week, and Past Due Cases, have undergone significant transformations. These modifications involve additional metrics to enhance the reporting capabilities of customer engagement functionality. The addition of multiple columns to the list reports and adjustments in graphical representations contributes to a more thorough analysis of the effectiveness of the case management process. Enablement: These features are automatically enabled as part of the release.
