In case the optimal location was not allocated, this dashboard provides the reason(s) as to why that location was not selected. Furthermore, the dashboard also provides the locations most impacted by each reason, and an approximate potential savings that would result from resolving each reason. Today, we track the following reasons: Supply, Protection, Capacity, Outage, and Shipping. See below for more details on each section of the dashboard. One month of data can be selected, as far back as one year in the past. Data is refreshed every 5 minutes. Any data populated previous to the 25.1 release will be purged after 3 months, and any data populated after the 25.1 release will get purged after 1 year. Note: All dollar savings on the dashboard are based on Fulfillment Optimization Level 1 factors only, and may have a small margin of error due to the time difference between the promising cost calculation and the subsequent Postgame cost calculation. Hence, savings should be considered an estimate. Furthermore, this dashboard reflects the first allocation attempt. If an order is allocated or re-allocated after the initial attempt, the latter allocation is not reflected in the dashboard. Configuration In order to turn on this feature and see data on the dashboard, all of the below steps need to be configured. If already completed before the 25.2 release, Step 4 must be performed again after 25.2 release to access the latest enhancements to the dashboard. 1. "Enable Postgame Spotlight" must be set to true in Promising Config Parameters 2. At least one ANF factor must be configured in the "Optimize" tab of the "Fulfillment Optimization" UI 3. Additionally, users must have the following grants to access the dashboard: inventoryfacade::postgamedashboard::view inventoryfacade::postgamedashboard omui::promising::menu::SimulationResult 4. Use the below endpoint and payload to create initial seed data in every org that receives orders. Alternatively, one profile can be shared across multiple organizations.

Perform a profile copy for ago:override using the below API for all profiles that receive orders. Alternatively, one profile can be shared across multiple organizations. POST {{url}}/agg-omni/api/fwcore/profiles/copy { "FromProfileId": "base", "ToProfileId": "ecomorg",  //change this to the profile ID where orders are received "ProfilePurpose": "ago::overrides" } Overview Section The overview section provides high-level information on how many orders were allocated using the optimal location compared to orders that were not allocated to the optimal location (Opportunities). Opportunities are made up of orders that were backordered and orders that were allocated, but to a location other than the optimal location. Optimization Results Breakdown This pie chart and table gives the information below: Customer Orders: This is the total count of fulfillment groups that fall within the timeframe selected by the date picker. Optimized: Fulfillment Groups that were allocated to an optimal location. Opportunities: Fulfillment Groups that were either allocated to a non-optimal location or that were backordered. Backordered: Fulfillment Groups with at least one unit that was backordered. This is a subset of opportunities. A backordered fulfillment group is never considered optimal. Optimal Location: The cheapest location(s) according to ANF level 1 factors One fulfillment group may have more than one optimal location if there is a tie or if other locations fall within the tolerance between ANF levels. Optimized Trend Tracker This area graph shows the percent of optimized orders, opportunities, and backorders over time. Hovering over different points will display the exact percentage. Backorders, in this case, represent any fulfillment group with at least one backordered unit. The date range of this area graph will change based on the dates selected in the time picker at the top of the page. Backordered Units This area graph shows the percent of backordered units over time (backordered units divided by total requested units). Fulfillment Optimization Opportunities Section The Fulfillment Optimization Opportunities section provides further details on the reasons why opportunity orders did not get allocated to an optimal location, the percentage of opportunities that can be optimized by resolving a single reason, potential savings (if all reasons are resolved), and top contributing locations. If a Fulfillment Group is not optimal for any reason other than Supply, Protection, Capacity, Outage, and Shipping, the Fulfillment Group will not be represented in any reason-specific widget. Examples of reasons not supported include location scheduling issues, Requested Delivery Date not being met, partially missing capacity definitions, or an item not being found in ATC View. Opportunities By Reason This bar graph provides the count of opportunities that were impacted for each reason. Some opportunity orders may not be optimal for multiple reasons; these orders would, therefore, show up in more than one bar in the chart. The light blue subsection of the bar represents Fulfillment Groups that have at least one backordered unit. Single Reason Opportunities Percent This metric gives the percentage of opportunities that were only impacted for one reason. Orders that are not optimal due to a single reason per location are more easily actioned upon by addressing the most pressing reason. Split shipments are not considered in this metric. The Recommendations section below gives more insight into the single-reason opportunities. Potential Savings This metric provides the potential "savings" that would result if every opportunity order were to be allocated to the optimal location. This is calculated by subtracting the theoretical "Optimal" Level 1 costs from the actual Level 1 costs. Since fully backordered orders do not have an actual cost, the savings is considered zero for all fully backordered orders. Partially backordered orders can have savings because any units that were allocated will have an actual cost and an "Optimal" cost. Top Contributing Locations This table provides the 3 locations having the most opportunities for all reasons (single-reason and multiple reasons). The table also includes the count of opportunity orders at each location and the total savings if each location was resolved for all reasons. Recommendations Section This section contains a metric for each supported reason the optimal location was not chosen: capacity, inventory, protection, outage, or shipping. Each tile provides the potential savings if that reason was resolved, along with the count of orders impacted. Split shipments are not considered in this section. In other words, orders that are not optimal due to a single reason at a single location are represented in the Recommendations section. This way, the orders that are easier to resolve are highlighted. If a Fulfillment Group is not optimal for any reason other than Supply, Protection, Capacity, Outage, and Shipping, the Fulfillment Group will not be represented in this section. Examples of reasons not supported include location scheduling issues, Requested Delivery Date not being met, partially missing capacity definitions, an item not being found in the ATC View, or no supply record found. Top 3 Recommendations The top widget in the Recommendations section provides the top three recommendations. These recommendations are tailored to the three most pervasive reasons and the top three locations contributing to opportunities for that reason. Inventory Widget If an order did not get allocated to the optimal location due to inventory as the reason, it means there was no sufficient inventory to fulfill the order at the optimal location. This widget displays the following information: Total savings if this reason was resolved completely. Total orders impacted by this reason. The top 3 locations having the most opportunity orders for this reason. Savings per location bar graph For the Inventory reason alone, there may be savings for backordered opportunities, but only in the case of a partial backorder when at least one unit is allocated. For a fully backordered order, the savings will always be zero because savings are the actual cost minus the optimal cost. In the case of a fully backordered order, there is no actual cost, so savings cannot be calculated. Note: The sum of all locations' savings has a possibility of being greater than the total savings given at the top of the tile. This is because, if multiple locations are tied for "optimal" location, all "optimal" locations show up in the bar graph, having their own savings. The total savings at the top of the tile, on the other hand, only considers the most optimal location savings. Upon clicking View Details, users can see the following tables. Unavailable Products: This table gives the top ten departments and top ten items per department that contributed to opportunity orders due to inventory as a single reason for the selected date range. Unavailable Products by Location: For the highest opportunity locations, see the top five departments contributing to opportunity orders due to inventory as a single reason for the selected time range, along with the order count for each department at the given store. Note: The DepartmentName field must be populated in Item master for data to appear in this visual Capacity Widget If an order did not get allocated to the optimal location due to capacity as the reason, it means the optimal location did not have sufficient capacity. The Capacity reason is only tracked if 'Exclude inventory from facilities at full capacity' is selected in the ATC View or if 'Consider Capacity' is selected in the Fulfillment Optimization Strategy. This widget displays the following information: Total savings if this reason was resolved completely. Total orders impacted by this reason. The top 3 locations having the most opportunity orders due to this reason. Savings per location bar graph Note: The sum of all locations' savings has the possibility of being more significant than the total savings given at the top of the tile. This is because if multiple locations are tied to the "optimal" location, all "optimal" locations show up in the bar graph, having their own savings. The total savings at the top of the tile, on the other hand, only considers the most optimal location savings. Upon clicking View Details: Users can see the top ten locations contributing to opportunity orders due to capacity as a single reason, along with each location's daily opportunity order count and backorder count. The backorder count is a subset of the opportunities. Recommendation: The recommended increase in capacity is calculated by taking the average opportunity orders per day. Outages Widget If an order did not get allocated to the optimal location due to an outage as the reason, it means there was an active Fulfillment Outage at the optimal location. This widget displays the following information: Total savings if this reason was resolved completely. Total orders impacted by this reason. The top 3 locations having the most opportunity orders due to this reason. Savings per location bar graph Note: The sum of all locations' savings has the possibility of being more significant than the total savings given at the top of the tile. This is because if multiple locations are tied to the "optimal" location, all "optimal" locations show up in the bar graph, having their own savings. The total savings at the top of the tile, on the other hand, only considers the most optimal location savings. Upon clicking View Details: Users can see the top ten locations contributing to opportunity orders due to Fulfillment Outage as a single reason, along with each location's daily opportunity order count and backorder count. The backorder count is a subset of the opportunities. Shipping Widget If an order did not get allocated to the optimal location due to shipping as the reason, it means one of two things: either a Lane Configuration is missing, or "ValidateServiceLevel" is enabled in Promising Config Parameters and the cheapest location does not support the requested service level (configured in Inventory Location). This widget displays the following information: Total savings if this reason was resolved completely. Total orders impacted by this reason. The top 3 locations having the most opportunity orders due to this reason. Savings per location bar graph Note: The sum of all locations' savings has the possibility of being more significant than the total savings given at the top of the tile. This is because if multiple locations are tied to the "optimal" location, all "optimal" locations show up in the bar graph, having their own savings. The total savings at the top of the tile, on the other hand, only considers the most optimal location savings. Upon Clicking View Details: Users can see the top ten locations contributing to opportunity orders due to Shipping as a single reason, along with each location's daily opportunity order count and backorder count. The backorder count is a subset of the opportunities. Protection Widget If an order did not get allocated to the optimal location due to protection as the reason, it means there was no sufficient inventory at the cheapest location, but if the Availability Rule (Rule Set) protection was not present, then there would have been sufficient inventory. This widget displays the following information: Total savings if this reason was resolved completely. Total orders impacted by this reason. The top 3 locations having the most opportunity orders due to this reason. Savings per location bar graph Note: The sum of all locations' savings has the possibility of being more significant than the total savings given at the top of the tile. This is because if multiple locations are tied to the "optimal" location, all "optimal" locations show up in the bar graph, having their own savings. The total savings at the top of the tile, on the other hand, only considers the most optimal location savings. Upon clicking View Details, users can see the following tables. Protected Products: This table gives the top ten departments and top ten items per department that contributed to opportunity orders due to protection as a single reason for the selected date range. Protected Products by Location: For the highest opportunity locations, see the top five departments contributing to opportunity orders due to protection as a single reason for the selected time range, along with the order count for each department at the given store. Note: If View Details button is not visible, repeat step 4 in the configuration steps above. If no data is present inside View Details, ensure DepartmentName field is populated in Item master for all items.
