Critical events are business or technical failures that help understand the application issues and troubleshoot them. Logging of critical events promotes proactive resolution of automatically tracked issues and reduces back-and-forth communication with the clients/ users who report them. This package contains all the entities which have information about the critical events. These entities are derived from the device management component and linked to the transactional entities of different components.
