The need for inventory allocation is computed based on one&nbsp;or a combination of the need variables, like a plan (or planned sales), metric (or actual sales) or forecast (system computed forecasted sales). Plan or planned sales are computed in the retailers&#39; host systems and then interfaced into the allocation application. The plan could be at the leaf or aggregate level in the item and location hierarchy. Allocation computes&nbsp;need using&nbsp;plans at Style or Style-color and Store level.&nbsp;Plans that are at aggregate levels in the user&#39;s host system should be disaggregated at the leaf level before being interfaced with allocation.
