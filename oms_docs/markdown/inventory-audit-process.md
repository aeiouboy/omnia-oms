This information can be used to&nbsp;analyze the inventory transactions for&nbsp;manual adjustments, cycle counts, receipts, resolve error, and out of stock. The inventory audit does not show transaction information outside of the&nbsp;manual adjustments, cycle counts, receipts, resolve error, and out of stock. Available Inventory Audit Information Inventory audit is updated when items are received or manually adjusted by the store employee based on the configuration mentioned in the&nbsp;Inventory Audit Configuration&nbsp;guide.&nbsp;Inventory audit identifies an increase, a decrease, or movement of the inventory.&nbsp; For Inventory Audit,&nbsp;only SIM transactions are supported. Any changes made outside of SIM (ie: POS or Supply Events) may not appear in the inventory audit logs. The following fields are available at a supply event for Inventory audit purposes.
