This popup will provide users with the option to either switch to offline mode or remain in online mode. Additionally, users can manually switch to offline mode, even when network connectivity is available, by selecting the option from the hamburger menu in the POS application. Once in offline mode, a banner will appear on the screen indicating that the system is offline. If there is no network connectivity, the left side of the banner will display the network status as "Disconnected." Network status as "Checking" is displayed when the system is in the process of checking for network connectivity. In offline mode, users can log out of the system from the right-side of the banner. While network connectivity is not available. Transition from offline/online When network connectivity is restored, the network status displays as "Connected." The system then checks for any pending transaction syncs to ensure all data is up-to-date. Once the network is restored and the system begins syncing data, a syncing indicator appears, showing the progress of the sync. After the syncing process is completed, users are prompted with a "System Online" popup, offering the option to either "Go Online" or "Stay Offline." If the user clicks "Go Online" and was initially logged in offline (i.e., launched the application without network connectivity), the system will redirect to the login page. The user will need to log in using their username and password. If the user transitions from online to offline mode, clicking "Go Online" will automatically take them to the online cart. Note that the hamburger menu is disabled in offline mode. An unauthenticated API enables seamless network connectivity checks, managing document uploads, downloads, and transaction syncing. The environment property ZUULSERVER_WEBNAMES requires an update where the omni URL must be included as part of its value.Ensure backend is updated with the required environment property for deployment. Offline and online orders can have the same sequence number. Store and Till Opening Messages in the "System Back Online" Prompt During Offline-to-Online Transition When the system comes back online, an informational message will appear if the store or till is not open. This message will prompt you to take the necessary actions to ensure the smooth synchronization of offline orders to the cloud. Launching the POS Application in Offline It is mandatory to log in to the homescreen of Manhattan Active® Omni POS Online App using your username and password after the initial installation. If the Manhattan Active® Omni POS application is launched without a network connection, users must authenticate using their name and PIN. If a user loses network connectivity after entering their login credentials, the option to launch the offline application will be available. If the user has not logged into the Cart Next Gen application while online before launching the POS application in offline mode, and the store is closed, they will be prompted to select the business day before initiating any transactions. Data Synchronization Inbound Data Synchronization Data synchronization occurs when the application is online. Upon logging into the application and after the Home Screen has fully loaded, the inbound sync process is initiated. Master Data Sync (User, Grant, Item, Price, Tax, and Promotions for Windows) This sync ensures that all necessary master data required for offline operation, including User, Grant, Item, Price, and Tax information, is retrieved from the central server to the local device.Additionally, for Windows devices, promotion data is also downloaded and stored locally to enable offline promotional functionality. This data is imported into the POS application based on the Supported Register Type configuration under POS Store Configuration. If the Supported Register Type is set to Fixed, the data will be imported only if the POS application is using a Fixed register type. Refer to Offline Enablment by Register Type configuration section. Master data is successfully synced once per calendar day. Once the sync is successfully completed for the current day, it will not be triggered again until the next calendar day. This sync ensures that all necessary master data required for offline operation, including User, Grant, Item, Price, and Tax information, is retrieved from the central server to the local device. Item with Price:only items with an active (non-zero) price will be imported to the device. Items with a zero price will be excluded from the offline item data. Configuration Data Sync A small set of configuration data, such as payment types supported in offline mode and offline templates, is synced each time the user logs into the application online after the Home Screen has fully loaded, as well as when the user accesses Cart Next Gen. Prerequisites for Offline Readiness: Once the synchronization process is successfully completed and all the required data is available for offline operation, the "Switch to Offline" option will appear in the hamburger menu on the Home Screen. This indicates that the application is ready for offline use. First-Time Installation: When the application is installed for the first time, users must verify that the "Switch to Offline" option appears in the hamburger menu on the Home Screen before proceeding to operate in Cart Next Gen. This ensures that the application has completed the necessary data sync and is fully prepared to operate in offline mode, allowing the user to seamlessly transition between online and offline operations throughout the use of the application. Subsequent Data Updates: Subsequent updates to the master data are refreshed daily on first login to the register. Sync Failure Handling: If the data import is unsuccessful, the system will attempt to re-import the data with up to 20 retries. Subsequent logins will also trigger this process. If the data sync is successful during the first installation, but subsequent syncs fail, the system will continue using the last synchronized data, allowing the user to operate in offline mode. The "Switch to Offline" button in the Home Screen hamburger menu serves as an indicator that the application is ready to be used in offline mode. To manually switch to offline mode, users must navigate to Cart Next Gen and select "Switch to Offline" from there. Outbound Data Synchronization Order and Payment Data sync The outbound sync process ensures that all order and payment data collected during offline operation is accurately transferred to the Central Cloud server once the system is online. This process keeps transaction data updated and ensures that no data is left unsynced. If there are any unsynced transactions pending on the device, the outbound sync process will be initiated upon login to the application online while the home screen is fully loaded. The sync process will continue if the user clicks on Cart Next Gen or any other screen in the application. However, if the user clicks on Cart Next Gen and there are pending transactions to be synced, they will be switched to offline mode. When a transaction is successfully completed or voided by the user in offline mode, the system automatically attempts to sync and transfer the order and payment data to the cloud, based on network availability. The system will automatically attempt to sync data every minute to ensure that any pending transactions on the device are promptly transferred to the cloud. If the device was offline and the network connection is restored, the system will sync any pending data that was collected during the offline period. Once the order and payment data has been successfully synced to the cloud, the system will delete it from the local device to free up storage space, ensuring efficient device performance. The outbound sync process is critical for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of transaction data. It specifically handles orders made in offline mode and ensures that all data is updated in the central cloud system once the device is online. By syncing data promptly, the system helps prevent any data loss and ensures that in-store transactions are processed efficiently with accurate, up-to-date records. Register Information Data Register information, such as the Offline ready, Last Imported date, offline disable reason, and unsynced transaction count, will be sent to the central system every 5 minutes, regardless of the application mode. This data will help troubleshoot potential issues in offline. Order ID Generation When operating in offline mode, it's crucial to identify which device an order belongs to, especially since registers can be switched between devices. To address this, the order number generation logic has been updated to include the ShortDeviceId. This enhancement allows each transaction to be uniquely identified when operating in offline mode. It is important to note that this change is only applicable in offline scenarios. The online order number generation will continue to follow the existing format without the ShortDeviceId. For example, the transaction number will be generated using the following format: Type No.Of Digits Sample Value Transaction Type 2 01 Transaction Date (Business Date) 6 010524(MMDDYY) Store Number 4 1028 Register Number 3 999 Next Up Number 4 0945 Application mode 1 1 ShortDeviceId 4 W101 Check Digit 1 3 Offline Sample Order Number - 01010524102899909451W1013 For more details on Short Device Id refer to Short Device ID For make the offline order searchable in store app refer to Barcode Rule Changes to Identify Offline Orders Short Device Id The Short Device Id is a 4-character code that uniquely identifies a device based on its platform, store, and device number. It is stored in the DeviceInfo entity. This format allows each store to have up to 999 unique devices per platform, ensuring consistent device identification across deployments. Format <Platform Indicator><3-digit Sequence Number> Ex - W011 Section Description W Platform Indicator W = Windows I = iOS A = Android 011 Device Sequence A unique number assigned to each device within a store for the specific platform. In this example, it is the 011th device for the Windows platform in the store. Purpose of the Short Device Id With the introduction of the new POS system, offline functionality now operates at the device level. This means: Devices in a store no longer rely on an edge server for accessing master data. Instead, each device independently holds its own set of master data—such as items, prices, and taxes—and creates orders based on this local information. Orders are later synchronized with the cloud. Why a Unique Device Identifier Is Needed To accurately track where each order originates, we need a way to uniquely identify each device. This identifier must be: Compact enough to embed within the order Id Free of special characters Consistently formatted across platforms and locations Although each device already has a unique identifier (e.g., IPH-c84ae340c362), it's too long and contains special characters, making it unsuitable for use in order IDs. Introducing the Short Device ID To solve this, we introduced a new 4-character Short Device ID that: Clearly represents the platform, store, and device instance Can be easily embedded in order identifiers Enables quick device recognition and support tracing This Short Device ID will now be included as part of the order ID to ensure clarity and traceability across systems. Uniqueness and Behavior of the Short Device Id The Short Device ID is unique per location and platform combination. This allows each store to have up to 999 distinct devices per platform (e.g., Windows, Android, iOS). Device Reuse Across Stores The Short Device ID is not regenerated when a device is moved to another store. Since the orderId includes the StoreId, RegisterId, and ShortDeviceId, the likelihood of generating duplicate order IDs is very low. However, if a device is being reassigned to a different store, it is recommended to delete the existing DeviceInfo entry before shipment. This ensures clean re-registration and avoids potential conflicts in order tracking or diagnostics. How to Delete the DeviceInfo Entry Note: Only delete the DeviceInfo if you are certain the device is no longer associated with the original store. Step 1: Get the Current Device Id Open the POS app. Navigate to: Settings → POS. Note the Device Id displayed at the top of the screen. Step 2: Delete using OmniFacade Go to OmniFacade in your browser. Navigate to the DeviceInfo entity. Paste the copied Device Id into the Remote Id field. Click Search. From the filtered results, select the matching row. Click Delete to remove the entry. Generation of Short Device Id The Short Device ID is automatically generated only once, when the store app is installed for the first time on a device. Reinstalling the app (i.e., uninstalling and then reinstalling) does not trigger the generation of a new Short Device ID. Existing Devices If your organization already has active devices and you're enabling POS Offline, you’ll need to manually generate Short Device Ids for these existing devices. This is a one-time setup per organization. Once completed, any newly added device will automatically receive a Short Device Id upon its first install. Refer to the configuration guide to generate Short Device IDs for existing devices - Short Device ID Generation Handling Offline Transaction Data When the App Is Uninstalled in Offline Mode (Windows Only) If the POS application is uninstalled or reinstalled on a Windows device while the store is open or the WAN is down, it may affect the proper sequencing and sync of transactions. To prevent data loss, the system saves offline transaction details, including store sequence and transaction sequence numbers, in the device’s local folder (located under: Device > Downloads > Store > Offline). These files will be available even if the application is uninstalled. Upon reinstalling the application, the saved data will be restored to the local database while the user is on the home screen. Once the network is restored, offline transactions will sync to the cloud, and the transaction data will be deleted from the local folder. Please note that this approach is applicable only on Windows devices. If you uninstall or reinstall the app on iOS or Android while the store is open or during WAN downtime, and you have performed transactions in offline mode, this could affect transaction sequencing and synchronization, potentially leading to the loss of transaction data. Offline metric available in the MUP UI The system enables both store associates and IT support teams to access offline-related information in the MUP UI, assisting in troubleshooting offline operation issues.Detailed offline register information is accessible through the MUP screen. For more information on accessing the MUP screen, refer to the section User Role Grants for Accessing Offline Features and MUP UI in Configuration Guide. The MUP UI allows users to access various offline-related entities and their details. These can be navigated using the following path: MUP UI Link: <omni-url>/om/home Navigation Path: Application Config > Manage POS Config > POS Offline Config The key entities available are: Offline Export Master :Facilitates the export of offline-related data. Export Job Master: This has information about the latest export run. Offline Transactions : Displays details of offline transactions temporarily stored before syncing to the MAO order component. It includes the sync status for each transaction, indicating whether it has been successfully synced or failed. Users can also access the Offline Transaction Audit Log and Offline Transaction Tracking details in this section, which has reasons for failure and exception trace details. This data is read-only, allowing users to view transaction details without making any modifications. Offline Templates :Provides access to offline configuration templates for managing offline operations. Receipt Artifacts :encrypted receipt logo which is used on offline receipts. Register Info :Displays the current status and details of the register. Below are the key details it includes: Offline Ready: Indicates whether the register is ready to operate in offline mode. Offline Disabled Reason: Displays the reason if offline mode is disabled. Unsynced Order Count: If any order is pending to sync from local to the cloud. File Import and Download Details: Imported Date: shows the local device time when the file import process is completed. Downloaded Date: shows the local device time when the file download process is completed. The data is automatically updated and sent to the central system every 5 minutes, regardless of the application mode. However, if the application is running offline, the data in the central system may not be the latest, as it cannot sync the data while offline. Offline POS Functional Features Manhattan Active® Omni POS - offline mode provides essential features to ensure seamless in-store operations even when connectivity is lost. When operating in offline mode, users can perform various tasks such as creating in-store purchase carts, processing payments, and printing receipts without relying on the network. Sale Process Order Creation To initiate a sale transaction in offline mode, start by adding items to the cart using the Cart Next Gen option. Users can scan item barcodes or manually input item codes. Currently, adding a customer to the cart is not supported in offline mode, allowing for quick guest checkouts.Once the items are added to the cart, proceed to the checkout screen. Below are the sales modifiers supported offline: Price Override Item Void Transaction Void Apply Discount Tax Override Tax Exempt Currently, discount threshold configurations are not supported in offline mode. This includes maximum discount limits at the item level, threshold discounts, unit-level discounts, and role-based (Halo) discounts. Manager Override is supported in offline mode for selected functionalities, such as price override and tax-exempt. Tax Calculation During the checkout process, tax calculation is performed automatically to ensure accurate determination of the transaction subtotal, inclusive of applicable tax information. If any sale modifications, such as discounts or overrides, are applied to the transaction, the tax is recalculated in the cart before finalizing the checkout. Manhattan Active® Omni POS supports Advanced Tax v2 for local tax calculations in offline mode, ensuring consistent and precise tax computation. Regardless of the Tax Gateway specified in the order configuration, offline transactions will always use Advanced Tax v2 for tax handling. While this supports features such as tax rates defined by country, location, jurisdiction, tax code/product class, date ranges (start date time and end date time) and price thresholds, certain functionalities are not supported in offline mode, including incremental taxes, compound taxes (e.g., PIF in some jurisdictions) and tax holidays. When an offline order is synced to the central system, taxes are not recomputed.The order is saved as is, based on the tax calculations performed during the offline transaction. The system does not make additional calls to any configured tax gateway to re-calculate or record taxes upon syncing. Informational Tax: The Manhattan Active® Omni POS application now supports Informational Tax in offline. To configure the Informational Tax refer to the configuration Guide. Some regions use a VAT (Value Added Tax) instead of adding additional tax amount at the time of invoicing based on the value of goods/services provided. For additional information refer Tax. Payment Payment can be made using cash, credit card, and other prepaid custom tenders. ProcessThroughTerminal=False, PopCashDrawer=False and IncludeInDrawerCount=False, This configuration Payment Type is also supported in Offline. Receipt Generation After completing the transaction, users can print a physical receipt for the customer. In offline mode, only a physical receipt is supported. EMV-compliant receipts for offline card transactions (chip card) are supported, ensuring compliance with global payment standards and providing detailed transaction records. Retailers can enable or disable this feature using the business configuration receiptParams.receiptIncEmvPrimary and receiptParams.receiptIncEmvSecondary, with the default set to false. Navigate to the omnifacade: Application Configuration > Manage POS Configuration >Receipt Configuration > Receipt Parameter> select Receipt category> Receipt Inc Emv Primary and Receipt Inc Emv Secondary. Applying Promotions in Offline Mode ( Windows only) The  promotions function in offline allows store associates to apply promotions even when the system is in offline mode. To configure and enable promotions in POS offline mode, refer to this section Offline Promotion Configuration Overview of Offline Promotions and Their Purpose Offline promotions allow store associates to apply discounts, coupons, and other promotional offers even when the Manhattan Active® Omni POS application is operating in offline mode. This functionality ensures that customers continue to receive applicable discounts without disruptions, maintaining a seamless checkout experience. By storing promotional configurations locally on the device, the system can process promotions without needing real-time access to online databases or external servers. Ensure a consistent shopping experience by honoring ongoing promotional campaigns even during network outages. Enhance sales opportunities by allowing discounts, combo offers, and order-based promotions to be applied without interruption. How Promotions Work in Offline Mode When the Manhattan Active® Omni POS application is offline, it relies on locally stored promotional data to apply for eligible offers. The process works as follows: When a user logs into the application, the promo data is downloaded and stored in the IndexedDB as a zip file on the POS device. This data includes applicable promotions. The data is packaged in a compressed zip file and maintained in a local promo service database. When the POS application starts in offline mode, the local promo service retrieves and applies promotions based on preloaded rules. After the zip file is downloaded, background workers check if the promo service is running. If the service is running, a localhost request is made to the promo server to store the configuration and feature flags. These configurations are then saved to the local filesystem database of the promo server. If the promo service is not running, a health check worker runs every 5 minutes to verify its status. Once the service is active, the configuration zip file is sent to the promo server and stored locally. As the store associate adds items to the cart, the system automatically evaluates promotions based on predefined conditions. The applied promotions are reflected in the cart before finalizing the transaction. At the checkout, we evaluate the promotion if the promotion service is not available , then we show the toast message user informing that promotion service is not available they can choose to apply for manual discounts. Once the POS system reconnects to the network, all offline transactions and applied promotions are synchronized with the central database to maintain accurate sales and promotional tracking. Mechanism of Offline Promotions in POS The promotion component is packaged with the application and runs as a local Java service when the app is launched. This enables offline promotion support, provided the necessary environment variable is set. Promotion Service Initialization When you log in to the application, the promotion data is downloaded and stored in the IndexedDB as a zip file. Promotion Service Activation After the zip file is downloaded, background workers check if the promotion service is running. If the service is running, a localhost request is made to the promotion server to store the configuration and feature flags. These configurations are then saved to the local filesystem database of the promotion server. Health Check Mechanism If the promotion service is not running, a health check worker runs every 5 minutes to verify its status. Once the service is active, the configuration zip file is sent to the promotion server and stored locally. Using Offline Promotions Once the configurations are successfully stored, the promotion service is ready for use. When the system switches to offline mode, promotions will be available to use in the cart. Users can view the status of the Offline Promotion Service from the Register Information page within the POS application.If the service is ready, the Offline Promotion Service Status will indicate that promotions are available for offline use.If the service is not ready, the Offline Promo Service Unavailability Reason will display the reason for unavailability. For more details, refer to Register Information. Supported & Unsupported Promotion Types A table listing supported and unsupported promotions in offline mode Promotions Supported(Y)/Not Supported(N) Shipping Promotion N Order Promotion Y Single item promotion Y Combo Item Promotion Y Payment promotion N Emplyoee promotion N Coupon Y Offer number N Events Y Tags/ Exclusions Y Stackability Y Promotion Prompting Y Location group Y BounceBack N Extended attributes on all master data (Item) Y Configuring Order and OrderLine extended and base Attributes (labels) as Promotional Inclusions N When configuring promotion qualifiers using inclusion or exclusion criteria for Item attributes, ensure the selected item attribute is included in the offline item export file. Use the following template to add any required item attributes: "TemplateId": "OfflineExportTemplate" If you introduce any additional item attributes for promotions, it is your responsibility to update the export template accordingly to ensure the data is available offline. Note: Only Item attributes are supported for offline promotion qualifiers. Attributes related to order, customer, employee, payment, and order line are not supported in offline mode. For more details on the promotional process and its functionality, refer to the Item Pricing and Promotional Events Process documentation. Return Process In Offline mode, return items cannot be matched to an original order. Hence, it can be processed only as non-validated returns. Non-prepaid tender (Credit Card) and Prepaid tender is the supported refund payment type for the offline returns. Automatic refunds are not supported; only override tenders are allowed. Users can print return receipts for both Store and Customer copies during offline returns. To enable this functionality, refer to the Configuring Receipt Printing for Offline Returns section in Configuration Guide. Note : Exchange functionality is not supported offline. Therefore, users are not permitted to switch between cart mode and return mode after adding an item. Note: Partial refunds between any of the tenders are currently not supported in Offline mode. Reprint Last Transaction in Offline Mode Store associates can reprint the last completed sale or return transaction receipt while the system is in offline mode. This allows customers to receive a duplicate receipt when needed. Steps to Reprint Last Transaction: In offline mode, open the More Menu on the POS application and Select "Reprint Last Transaction". This option will be disabled during an active transaction. If the last transaction is available in offline mode, the system will display a print option. If the transaction has already been synced to the cloud and is no longer available offline, an error message will display: "Order Not Found. You may be able to reprint once you are back online." To enable this functionality, the user must have the required grant. Refer to the configuration guide for details on the necessary grant Screen Lock and Inactivity Timeout in Offline Mode To enhance security, the Manhattan Active® Omni POS application now supports Screen Lock and Timeout in offline mode. When the system remains idle for a defined period, the POS screen automatically locks, requiring store associates to re-authenticate before regaining access. This ensures compliance with security policies and prevents unauthorized access, even when the device is offline. Manual Screen Lock Function Key and Interaction of Screen Lock with Auto Recovery Feature are not supported in Offline mode. For detailed configuration and process, refer to the Screen Lock Guide. Localization Support in POS Offline Mode Localization is now supported in the offline mode of Manhattan Active® Omni POS. This enables translated labels, messages, and receipt content to be displayed based on the store associate’s configured locale, even when the POS is disconnected from the network. For configuration details, refer to the Localization Configuration section in the Configuration Guide. Internationalization in Offline The Manhattan Active® Omni POS application now supports internationalization in offline mode for Canada, ensuring compliance with Canadian standards such as currency formatting, nickel rounding, and taxes. Additionally Tax Holidays, Incremental Taxes, and Tax Exempt are not supported in offline mode. For detailed guidelines on Canada, please refer to the Canada Guide.
