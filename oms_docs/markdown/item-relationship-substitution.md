UIs and Entities Services Troubleshooting Related Articles Overview Item relationships in replenishment planning allow you to manage how SKUs interact, mainly when one SKU replaces another (temporarily or permanently) or when SKUs are sold as a collection. By linking SKUs, the system can: Replace SKUs: Handle temporary (promotional) and permanent SKU replacements. Manage Demand Flows: Direct demand from one SKU to many, or from many to one. Types of item relationship: Supercession: Permanent replacement of one SKU by another, often due to product phase-out. Substitution: Temporary SKU replacement, including promotional items impacting regular SKU sales. Item Relationship Validations: Each 'location' will have a different Item Relationship for the same Item. We cannot create one IR for multiple locations. Multiple IR's can be created with 'Data Loader'. Refer to data loader details for further reference. From Item To Item Location Item Relationship Item A Item B Location_1 IR-1 Item A Item B Location_2 IR-2 Item A Item B Location_3 IR-3 One 'To' Item can have multiple 'From' Items. From Item To Item Item A Item B Item C Item B The same 'From Item' cannot be part of two different 'To Item'. From Item To Item Validation Item A Item B IR can be created Item A Item C Cannot create an IR as Item A is already part of 'From Item' Chaining of Item Relationships cannot be possible (the same Item cannot be part of 'From' and 'To' Item) From Item To Item Validation Item A Item B IR can be created Item B Item C Cannot create IR as Item B is already part of 'To Item' Multiple IR's for the same 'From' and 'To' Item and 'Location' cannot be created. Process Flow: Data Element Description From Item Depends on relationship type: • Supercession – The old item • Substitution – The item temporarily being replaced To Item Depends on relationship type: • Supercession – The new item • Substitution – The item temporarily replacing the existing one Begin Date The date the substitution or supersession begins at the lowest echelon. Note: a. Only for substitution or supersession. b. Cannot be changed after activation at any location. End Date The date sales of the regular item resume after substitution ends. Note: a. Only for substitution. b. Cannot be changed after deactivation at any location. Item Relationship Type Displays the selected type in Item Relationship Maintenance. Types include: Supercession, Substitution, Kit, Display, Bill of Material as Kit SKUs. Conversion Ratio Used when the new SKU is a multiple of the old SKU (e.g., packaging changes). Adjusts demand and stock status accordingly. Note: Manipulation of history due to ratio can be done by Forecasting. Location Lists the location(s) where the item relationship applies. Copy History Options for history transfer: • No Copy – Do not copy history • Copy – Add From SKU history to To SKU • Replace – Replace To SKU history with From SKU history. Life Cycle Policy - From Life Cycle Policy assigned to the From SKU when activated. Note: If deleting relationship without specifying, current policy remains. Syncs with Demand Forecasting when integrated. Life Cycle Policy - To Life Cycle Policy assigned to the To SKU when activated. Note: Same as above regarding deletion and integration with Demand Forecasting. Initialize Forecast Enables forecast initialization for the replaced or substitute item to ensure accurate demand forecasting and replenishment planning. Deplete Higher Echelon Inventory (Activation) When checked, activation is advanced until on-hand of From SKU is depleted at higher echelon. Note: All lower echelons must be included to avoid ongoing replenishment. Accumulate Forward Sales Target From: When checked, adds sales history of 'To Item' during substitution to 'From Item'. To: When checked, adds sales history of 'From Item' during substitution to 'To Item'. Note: Maintained by Demand Forecasting when integrated. Accumulate Stock Status From: Adds on-hand, on-order, committed quantities of To SKU to From SKU. To: Adds on-hand, on-order, committed quantities of From SKU to To SKU. Revert History The history will revert to its original, pre-item relationship state. Default behavior in active SCP. Retain History Indicates whether to retain or accumulate history from the From Item. Actual Activation Date The date when substitution or supersession was actually activated. Only for substitution or supersession. Actual Deactivation Date The date when substitution was actually deactivated. Only for substitution. Sample for Computing Adjusted sales units: From Item To Item Relationship status From Item (Sales) To Item (Sales) Accumulate Forward Sales (From Item) Accumulate Forward Sales (To Item) Expected Result: From Item Sales Expected Result: To Item Sales Item 1 Item 2 Not yet Activated 100 20 No Yes 100 20 Item 1 Item 2 Activated 100 20 No Yes 100 120 Item 1 Item 2 Not yet Activated 100 20 Yes Yes 100 20 Item 1 Item 2 Activated 100 20 Yes Yes 120 120 Sample for computing the inventory position: From Item To Item Relationship status From Item (OH / On order/Committed) Stock To Item (OH / On order/Committed) Stock Accumulate OH / On order/Committed Quantity (From Item) Accumulate OH / On order/Committed Quantity (To Item) Expected Result: From Item OH / On order/Committed Stock Expected Result: To Item OH / On order/Committed Stock Item 1 Item 2 Not yet Activated 10 20 Yes/No Yes/No 10 20 Item 1 Item 2 Activated 10 20 No Yes 10 30 Item 1 Item 2 Activated 10 20 Yes No 30 20 Item 1 Item 2 Activated 10 20 Yes Yes 30 30 Item 1 Item 2 Activated 10 20 No No 10 20 Item 1 Item 2 Activated 10 0 No Yes 10 10 Item 1 Item 2 Activated 10 0 Yes No 10 0 Data Loader Details : The data loader allows user to create multiple Item Relationships in bulk. This is a kind of bulk import. It is particularly useful when users need to update or create numerous item relationships across different locations. The UI offers both import and export options for the data loader on the Item Relationship screen. A sample file has been attached for reference. User can also obtain sample file by exporting data through data loader. Configuration: The process of managing a substitution typically involves creating the relationship, defining its terms, and understanding its impact on inventory and replenishment. Item Relationship configuration: Supercession: Item Relationship - Supercession /itemlocation/api/itemlocation/itemRelationship/save { "FromItemId": "OD71", "ToItemId": "OD72", "LocationId": "OG_ST71", "BeginDate": "2024-02-09", "ConversionRatio": 1.0, "InitializeForecastOnActivation": false, "AccumulateForwardSalesToItem": true, "AccumulateOnHandToItem": true, "AccumulateOnOrderToItem": true, "FromItemLifeCycleStatusOnActivation": "ACTIVE", "ToItemLifeCycleStatusOnActivation": "ACTIVE", "ItemRelationshipType": "Supersession", "CopyHistoryType": "Add", "Accumulate Committed Quantity To Item":false, "Deplete Higher Echelon Inventory":false Substitution: Item Relationship - Substitution /itemlocation/api/itemlocation/itemRelationship/save { "FromItemId": "a", "ToItemId": "b", "BeginDate": "2025-06-04", "EndDate": "2025-06-05", "ItemRelationshipType": { "ItemRelationshipTypeId": "Substitution" }, "ConversionRatio": 1.0, "LocationId": "e", "CopyHistoryType": { "CopyHistoryTypeId": "None" }, "FromItemLifeCycleStatusOnActivation": "ACTIVE", "ToItemLifeCycleStatusOnActivation": "ACTIVE", "InitializeForecastOnActivation": false, "DepleteHigherEchelonInventoryOnActivation": false, "AccumulateForwardSalesFromItem": false, "AccumulateForwardSalesToItem": false, "AccumulateOnHandFromItem": false, "AccumulateOnHandToItem": false, "AccumulateOnOrderFromItem": false, "AccumulateOnOrderToItem": false, "AccumulateCommittedQuantityFromItem": false, "AccumulateCommittedQuantityToItem": false, "FromItemLifeCycleStatusOnDeactivation": "ACTIVE", "ToItemLifeCycleStatusOnDeactivation": "ACTIVE", "RetainHistory": false, } How to set up an Item relationship? Supercession: Step 1: Define the Items From Item: Select the old SKU that will be permanently replaced. To Item: Select the new SKU that will permanently replace the old one. Step 2: Specify the Relationship Type Set the Item Relationship Type to Supercession to indicate a permanent replacement. Step 3: Set the Begin Date Enter the Begin Date when the new SKU starts being sold in place of the old SKU at the lowest echelon. Note: This date cannot be changed once the relationship is activated. Step 4: Adjust Conversion Ratio (if applicable) If the new SKU packaging or unit size differs (e.g., cases to eaches), specify the Conversion Ratio to correctly convert demand and stock quantities between the old and new SKUs. Step 5: Assign Locations Specify the Location(s) where the supercession applies. Step 6: Manage History Transfer Choose how demand history should be handled during the transition: No Copy: Don’t copy any history. Copy: Add the old SKU’s history to the new SKU. Replace: Replace the new SKU’s history with the old SKU’s history. Step 7: Set Life Cycle Policies Life Cycle Policy - From: Assign the life cycle policy for the old SKU upon activation (e.g., Inactive, Discontinued). Life Cycle Policy - To: Assign the life cycle policy for the new SKU upon activation (e.g., Active). Step 8: Enable Forecast Initialization (if applicable) Optionally enable Initialize Forecast for the new SKU to start accurate forecasting based on the transferred or existing data. Step 9: Higher Echelon Inventory Controls (Optional) Deplete Higher Echelon Inventory (Activation): Check this to delay activation until the old SKU’s inventory at higher echelons is depleted, preventing excess stock. Accumulate Forward Sales Target: Select to accumulate sales history if required. Accumulate Stock Status: Choose whether to combine stock quantities for a smooth transition. Step 10: Finalize and Activate Activate the supercession relationship. The system will record the Actual Activation Date when activated. Substitution: Step 1: Define the Items From Item: Select the SKU that will be temporarily replaced (the original item). To Item: Select the SKU that will temporarily replace the From Item (the substitute). Step 2: Specify the Relationship Type Set the Item Relationship Type to Substitution to indicate a temporary replacement. Step 3: Set the Dates Begin Date: Enter the date when the substitution will start (lowest echelon). Note: This cannot be changed once activated. End Date: Enter the date when sales of the original (From) item will resume. Note: This cannot be changed after deactivation. Step 4: Adjust Conversion Ratio (if applicable) If the substitute SKU represents a different unit size or packaging (e.g., cases vs. eaches), set the Conversion Ratio to convert demand and inventory accurately between SKUs. Step 5: Assign Locations Specify the Location(s) where this substitution applies. Step 6: Manage History Transfer Choose how sales and demand history should be handled: No Copy: No history is transferred. Copy: Add From Item’s history to the To Item. Replace: Replace To Item’s history with From Item’s history. Step 7: Set Life Cycle Policies Life Cycle Policy - From: Assign a policy to the From Item during substitution (e.g., Inactive, Discontinued). Life Cycle Policy - To: Assign a policy to the To Item during substitution (e.g., Active). Step 8: Enable Forecast Initialization Check Initialize Forecast to enable forecast initialization for the substitute SKU to support accurate demand forecasting and replenishment planning. Step 9: Higher Echelon Inventory Controls (Optional) Deplete Higher Echelon Inventory (Activation): Enable if you want to delay activation until the on-hand inventory of the From Item is depleted at higher levels. Accumulate Forward Sales Target: Select if you want to accumulate sales history between From and To Items during substitution. Accumulate Stock Status: Choose whether to accumulate stock (on-hand, on-order, committed) between the From and To Items. Step 10: History Behavior Revert History: Leave default if you want history to revert to original pre-substitution state after deactivation. Retain History: Select if you want to retain or accumulate history from the From Item during substitution. Step 11: Finalize and Activate Activate the substitution relationship. The system will record the Actual Activation Date upon activation. When the substitution ends, the system records the Actual Deactivation Date. Whenever a user creates an Item Relation with the RetainHistory flag as true, then the user should also need to configure any one of these below attributes, accumulateForwardSalesFromItem = true or accumulateForwardSalesToItem = true or CopyHistoryType = Add or Replace If a user does not configure any one of the above attributes when the RetainHistory Flag is true, then the system throws a validate error, Error msg → Set either AccumulateForwardSalesToItem or AccumulateForwardSalesFromItem to true, or set CopyHistoryType to Add or Replace. Error code → “ITL:181” To enable Item Relationship retain history feature, please enable the below feature flag and business configuration, Feature flag → "AI-31084#2025-06" (itemLocation) Business configuration → Make  ItemRelationshipRetainHistoryEnabled attribute as true (ItemLocation Parameters Entity). UIs and Entities The configuration UIs mentioned in this document are listed in the following table, along with information to navigate to the API documentation. UI Name Seed Data Present Seed Data Profile Item Relationship Screen Item Relationship ✔️ Item Relationship Item Location Screen Item Relationship ✔️ Item Relationship Suggested Order Details Item Relationship ✖️ / (Varies) – Item Location Analysis Item Relationship ✖️ / (Varies) – Services N/A Troubleshooting To troubleshoot supercession issues, ensure the Begin Date is correctly set and reached at the lowest echelon. Verify that demand history transfers properly by configuring the Copy History option to Copy or Replace. Enable forecast initialization and confirm the conversion ratio matches packaging changes to maintain accurate forecasts and inventory levels. Activate the Deplete Higher Echelon Inventory option to prevent replenishment of the old SKU after activation, and include all relevant locations in the relationship. Also, assign and sync appropriate life cycle policies with Demand Forecasting to avoid ordering conflicts. For substitution problems, check that the Begin Date is accurate and that demand history is correctly accumulated between SKUs using the Accumulate Forward Sales and Copy History settings. Plan substitution End Dates carefully since they cannot be changed after deactivation. Adjust stock accumulation settings to prevent inventory imbalances, and configure life cycle policies for both SKUs during deactivation. Use the depletion option at higher echelons to delay substitution activation until original stock is exhausted. Finally, verify activation and deactivation dates to ensure the system reflects the current status.
