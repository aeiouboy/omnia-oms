Customers can utilize the Aging Orders By Store Report, and Store Shorted Fulfillment Orders, by Reason Code Report to get on top of problematic orders. Reports such as the Store Metrics Report and the Store Fulfillment Sales Report help monitor daily progress. In addition, the reports include a date range, so customers can research progress over time, where applicable. Together, the body of reports allows managers to monitor the key events and processes. The store managers need to monitor the process at every stage to ensure on-time and accurate order fulfillment. Operational SCI for Order Fulfillment includes a list of monitoring reports providing data and metrics such as customer contact details, created and updated date of the orders, statuses, packaging info, store picking, packing, and shipped quantity, and more. These details help store managers to assess and analyze the order fulfillment process and implement strategies for improvement where required. You can access the monitoring reports in IBM Cognos by navigating to Team Content > SCI Packaged Content > Reports > OMNI > Store Order Fulfillment > Monitoring.
