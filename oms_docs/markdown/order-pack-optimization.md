Otherwise, this policy will be used only for rounding up the order quantity to convenience packs. Order pack optimization packs will have a lower handing cost per each. Set up Order Pack Optimization: Refer&nbsp;How to set up Order pack&nbsp;optimization&nbsp;for more details. Use Convenience Pack or Optimize Order Pack flow: When Order Pack optimization is enabled for a specific Item and Location, follow the Order Pack Optimization flow. If Order Pack optimization is disabled, proceed with using the Convenience Pack Pre -Requisite to evaluate Order Pack Optimization Create Item Create Handling Cost Policy Add Protection Level and add a Unit of Measure as Each, Case and Pallet. Attach Protection Level to the Item created on the Item screen.

If the extra&nbsp;carrying cost is greater than this limit, the pack size will not be considered as an eligible pack. &nbsp; /itemlocation/api/itemlocation/itemLocation/save {&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;MaxExtraCarryingCost&quot;:2, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;MaxExtraCarryingCostPercent&quot;:null, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;UseOrderPackOptimization&quot;:true &nbsp; },&nbsp; &nbsp; The maximum extra carrying cost % that is acceptable for the pack size to be eligible for selection.
