When a rule matches, the corresponding forecast record is linked to an ExclusionRuleId, which indicates it should be excluded from being displayed on the UI. This feature helps ensure that only relevant exceptions are shown to users, improving the efficiency and relevance of the forecast exception management process. &nbsp; Process Flows Step 1: Exclusion Rule Configuration Users configure the exclusion rule in the Forecast Exception Policy UI under the Exclusion Rules section using the Manhattan Cloud Platform Rules framework. The user enters a rule name, description, and conditions (e.g., based on purchase price, demand forecast, lifecycle status, etc.). MUP UI Configuration Step 1: Exclusion Rule Definition Fields: Rule Name, Description. Step 2 : Rule Conditions Fields like annualDemandForecast, currentDemandForecast, etc., require attributes, operators, and values. Step 2: Rule Evaluation When a forecast exception is generated, the system evaluates the Exclusion Rules. If the first active rule matches, the&nbsp;ExclusionRuleId&nbsp;is applied to the forecast record, and the exception is excluded from the UI. No further rules are evaluated once a match is found. Step 3: User Interface Update The Forecast UI will hide exceptions linked to a forecast record with an&nbsp;ExclusionRuleId. The rules are evaluated in the order they are listed, and only the first matching rule applies. Configuration Note: The UI is meant for rule setup, and these APIs are for informational purposes only. exclusionRule.json Exclusion Rule{ &nbsp; &quot;PK&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;ContextId&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;Process&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;CreatedBy&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;CreatedTimestamp&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;UpdatedBy&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;UpdatedTimestamp&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;ProfileId&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;ExclusionRuleId&quot;: null, &nbsp; &quot;Description&quot;: null } CRUD Operations for Rules Endpoint:{{url}}/ai-forecast/api/rules/ruleCondition Method: GET/POST/DELETE Description: Enable Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for exclusion rules.
