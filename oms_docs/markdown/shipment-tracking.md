Other attributes are not supported.) Tracking details To access the Shipment Tracking UI, a customer can use the 'Track Package' link provided in the shipment confirmation email/text or via the link provided in an e-commerce site. One Shipment Tracking page is required per package; the status of other items in the order are available by clicking the 'Order Details' button. Self-Service makes a real-time API call to the carrier such as FedEx to retrieve the latest package status. Out of the box integration exists for FedEx, UPS, and USPS. Integration with other carriers needs to be added as part of the project. Orders with Multiple Packages If an order is shipped in multiple packages, additional shipment tabs are displayed. A customer can click through each tab to view the status of each package on the order. A maximum of 10 packages are displayed. If a customer needs to see details of additional packages, the 'Contact Us' feature can be used to contact customer service. Status of Other Items in the Order Details of other items on the order can be seen by clicking 'Order Details.' For example, if a customer has ordered two items and only one is shipped, this page helps answer the customer's question "Where is my other item?" to avoid a call to customer service. This page groups items by status groups. As with all UI labels, the status names can be customized to suit the business needs. For items which are shipped, users can click the 'View Shipment' button to view the tracking details of the package. Status Group Statuses Included Delivered Delivered Shipped Fulfilled, Picked Up Preparing to Ship Allocated, Released, In Process, Picked, Packed, or any extension of these statuses Back Ordered Back Ordered, Open Cancelled Cancelled Returned Pending Return, Returned Within each status group, a maximum of ten items is displayed to ensure optimal page performance. For example, if there are 12 delivered items, then the Delivered section displays only 10. Access Point Details When a package is re-routed to an access point due to a failed delivery or pickup location change, and UPS provides the Access Point ID in the tracking API response, the access point details are displayed within the shipment tracking status panel. The Digital Self Service page displays the location name, address, hours, and phone number along with the pickup date provided by the carrier. If the package is not routed to an access point or if the package is routed to an access point, but the carrier does not provide the Access Point ID, the shipment tracking page displays the package status and delivery updates. Note: Access Point integration is currently supported for UPS only. Time Zones The tracking details are currently displayed in the time zone as returned by the carrier; no time zone conversion is done in self-service. UPS and USPS currently return event time stamps in the time zone of their respective locations, and FedEx currently returns time stamps in UTC. For example: Event 1: Atlanta, GA 2:00 PM EST Event 2: Los Angeles, CA 6:00 PM PST Event 1 is displayed in EST because Atlanta, GA is in EST. Event 2 is displayed in PST because Los Angeles, CA is in PST. Opt In Text Messages A customer can use the Opt-In feature to receive text messages about the shipment, such as shipment progress notification or delivery updates. This feature displays an Opt-In prompt message, a details hyperlink next to the prompt, a text box to enter a phone number, a phone number country code drop-down, and a Sign-Up button. A customer can hover over the details hyperlink to read the details of the opt-in feature, such as terms and conditions, or privacy agreement, as configured by the retailer. To opt-in, a customer can enter their phone number and click Sign Up. If a valid phone is entered, the customer will be subscribed to receive text messages about the order's updates. Note: The phone number entered while opting in, is saved on the Order Customer Comm Preferences, as PreferredPhoneNumber for Interaction Type Id "TextMessage". If a customer has already opted into receiving text notifications about their order, they are presented with the option to stop receiving messages. Upon clicking "Stop Receiving Messages," the order Customer Comm Preferences is updated to stop all text messages, and a success message is displayed to the customer. The customer can opt-in again if they change their mind. Customizing Country List By default, country codes for all countries are displayed in the country code prefix drop-down for the Opt-In text message feature. This list of countries in the drop-down can be customized to display a specific list by configuring countries in the Text Message Supported Countries UI. Note that, only the list of countries that are configured on the Text Message Supported Countries UI will start appearing in the opt-In country code prefix drop-down, overriding the default behavior of displaying all the countries. The configured list of countries will only be sorted in alphabetical order irrespective of the display order assigned in the configuration. Notes : 1. The Opt-In feature is currently displayed only on the Shipment Tracking and Return Tracking pages. 2. To enable the feature, refer to the Opt-In configuration section. 3. Contact the services team to add translations for the labels introduced for this feature. Capture Customer Survey Feedback This feature allows the retailer to capture customer feedback through Net Promoter Survey (NPS), including optional comments. The NPS style feedback involves presenting the user with one question and capturing the rating and optional comments, if any. The question can be modified using a localizable value. The rating values are from 0 through 10, the "not likely" localizable label is displayed under the rating number 0 & the "most likely" localizable label is displayed under the rating number 10. Once the user clicks the rating, an area is available for customers to add optional comments along with a Submit button. The rating is saved without comments as soon as any rating number is clicked. If a user enters a comment and clicks Submit, then the rating is saved along with comments.  Once the rating and comments are submitted, a success message is displayed. In the mobile form factor, the success message is fleeting and is shown only for 4 seconds, to ensure efficient use of vertical space. Notes : 1. The Customer Survey is currently displayed only on the Shipment Tracking and Return Tracking pages. 2. To enable the feature, refer to the Customer Survey configuration section. 3. Contact the services team to add translations for the labels introduced for this feature. Configuration The following configuration is required for shipment tracking. See detailed instructions for each step below. Configure your organization and user to be used for self-service authentication - see the Authentication Guide for detailed steps. This only needs to be done once per organization, so no action is required if it's already been done. Add credentials for the FedEx, UPS, and USPS tracking APIs Add carrier response mappings for FedEx, UPS, and USPS Enable shipment confirmation emails. To configure outbound messages for generating emails or text messages, see the Transactional Emails and Transactional Texts guides. Optional: If using other carriers, add carrier configuration and status mappings Optional: If using any custom statuses, add UI label mappings Optional: If using opt in text message, select "Enable Opt In Text Messages in Self Service Pages" on the Digital Self Service Configuration UI. Optional: If capturing Customer Survey feedback, select "Enable Customer Survey in Self Service Pages" on the Digital Self Service Configuration UI. Optional: If using the Shipment/Return Tracking Version2 UI, select "Enable Version2 UI for Shipment and Return Tracking" on the Digital Self Service Configuration UI. Add Credentials for FedEx, UPS, and USPS 3rd Party Accounts Seed data exists out of the box for FedEx, UPS, and USPS. If you only use these 3 carriers, you only need to complete step 1 below. If you use any additional carriers, then follow steps 1 and 2. Use the Carrier Facility Accounts UI or the below API to upload carrier accounts to use for integrating with each third party. Each account should have a null facilityCode, as facilityCode is used for SIF, but a single account with a null facilityCode must be configured for delivery tracking in Self-Service or call center. The below sample json can be used for testing, but these credentials should not be used in production; contact your customer to get their UPS, FedEx, and USPS account information. POST /parcel/api/parcel/upgradedFacilityAccount/save { "IsActive": false, "UpgradedFacilityAccountId": "2", "CarrierCode": "FDXE", "FacilityCode": "11224", "VersionId": "1", "PrimaryAccountNumber": "2312124214", "SecondaryAccountNumber": "123123", "UserKey": "User1314", "Password": "2313a@3#$", "HubId": "21424" } OR POST /parcel/api/parcel/facilityAccount/import { "data": [ { "UserKey": "USERKEY", "PrimaryAccountNumber": "ACCTNUM", "CarrierCode": "FDXG", "SecondaryAccountNumber": "ACCTNUM2", "Password": "PASSWORD" } ] } The Upgraded facility account does not support a null facility code. To support shipment tracking, the null facility code entry must be configured on the (legacy) facility account. Add Response Mappings FedEx, UPS, and USPS Status Codes Each 3rd party carrier uses their own status codes to track packages. These status codes must be translated into a common status understood by Active® Omni, which is what the carrier status map entity does. To add status codes, upload the json to the API: POST /parcel/api/parcel/statusMap/import { "data": [{ "Status": "InTransit", "Description": "At Canada Post facility", "Code": "AC", "Provider": "FedEx", "StatusDescription": "In Transit" } ] } Add 3rd Party Carriers If using a carrier other than UPS, FedEx, or USPS, follow these steps: Build integration with the third party's tracking API by working with services. Configure a carrier in the Carrier UI or API (/parcel/api/parcel/carrier/save). Add carrier facility accounts using the Carrier Facility Accounts UI or API referenced above. Provide valid credentials for connecting with the 3rd party. Add entries in the Carrier Status Mapping UI or API (/parcel/api/parcel/statusMap/import). An entry should be configured for each of the mappings from the 3rd party carrier status to the internal statuses of either 'InTransit' or 'Delivered'. Modifying the Shipment Status Icon The status icons for out-of-the-box statuses can be changed via CSS. See here for details. UI Field Mappings Shipment tracking UI field mappings UI Field Entity/Attribute Max Length Additional Logic Status label Calculated on the fly from carrier response N/A If carrier status maps to 7000/Fulfilled, then the UI shows: "On Its Way" If carrier status maps to 7500/Delivered, then the UI shows: "Delivered" If status not found, then default to 7000/Fulfilled Status icon Calculated on the fly N/A If carrier status maps to 7000/Fulfilled, then the UI shows: Truck icon If carrier status maps to 7500/Delivered, then the UI shows: Man with package icon Delivered On / ETA date display Calculated on the fly from carrier response N/A If carrier status maps to 7000/Fulfilled, then the UI shows: "Arriving" + (delivery date from carrier response) If carrier status maps to 7500/Delivered, then the UI shows: "Delivered on" + (delivery date from carrier response) Tracking number Input from URL N/A Blue tile - Carrier logo Parcel.Carrier.LogoImageURI N/A If null, do not display any image Items in tile - item image Order.OrderLine.SmallImageURI N/A If null, display the default 'No Image Found' image Item image is linked to web URL if orderLine.itemWebURL is populated Items in tile - Item description Order.OrderLine.ItemShortDescription 50 If null, display no text Items in tile - Size Order.OrderLine.ItemSize 100 If null, display "--" Items in tile - Color Order.OrderLine.ItemColor 100 If null, display "--" Items in tile - Quantity Order.OrderLine.Quantity 16,4 Only items and quantities which are included in the package (get all fulfillment detail entities with given tracking number) Items in tile - Price Order.OrderLine.UnitPrice 16,2 Currency displayed based on Order.Currency If currency is null, then default to USD Tracking Details section Retrieved on the fly from carrier response N/A Displayed in descending chronological order: Time Tracking activity description City, State PostalCode Note: If the order is not in Delivered Status (7500) - Arriving On Date (ETA) is displayed; if the order is in Delivered Status, Delivered On (delivered date) is displayed. Delivered On date is mapped from the date of the latest event for "statusSubType": "Delivered" on the Parcel Tracking API response and ETA is mapped for the "estimatedDeliveryDate" on the tracking details section of the Parcel Tracking API response. If the order is in Delivered Status, but date is not populated on the latest event for "statusSubType": "Delivered" on the Parcel Tracking API response, the tracking page will display "Estimated delivery date not available" even though "estimatedDeliveryDate" on the tracking details section of the Parcel Tracking API response is populated.

The first panel displays the shipment progress for the given package, including the estimated delivery date or delivered date, detailed shipment activity, and the tracking number. The middle "What you're getting" panel displays the contents of the package and the status of any other remaining items on the order, such as shipped, preparing to ship, delivered, cancelled, or backordered. In the case of multiple shipments, tracking buttons are displayed for each package. When the customer clicks the track button, the shipment details of the package are displayed on the shipment activity panel along with the delivered dates for the package. Shipment Tracking Optimized UI Improvements Configuration Navigate to Menu > Proactive > Proactive Menu > Functional Config > Review Behavior Changes. For Change Name 'OM - DSS Shipment/Return Tracking:GUI Improvements', set Enabled to 'true'. If not enabled by the Must Enable By Date listed in this UI, the enhanced UI will automatically be enabled on this date. Configuring List of Countries for Text Messages To configure the list of countries for text messages, perform the following steps: Navigate to Manage POS Configuration > POS Customer Engagement Configuration > Text Messages Supported Countries On the Text Supported Countries UI, click Add. Enter the Country Id, Country Name, and Country Code. Select the business channel as SelfServe. Click Save to save the country code details. Version2 UI for B2B Shipment and Return Tracking This version of the Shipment Tracking page has updated content and layout, optimized for B2B orders. Retailers can use this version for their Shipment and Return Tracking pages by using configuration 'Enable Version2 UI for Shipment and Return Tracking'. Note: Use MUP UI for updating configuration 'Enable Version2 UI for Shipment and Return Tracking' and not the Masterfacade UI. This version is similar in overall layout to the existing version of the Shipment Tracking & Return tracking page. The first panel is the same in both versions and contains key information about the selected shipment, such as the status of the shipment and shipment activity. The following are key differences: In the second panel, the version2 UI has two separate cards to display (i) the content of the selected shipment (“what you’re getting” section) and (ii) the status of the remaining items in the order (“Other items in Order” section). The items in the shipment section, displays the total units shipped in the shipment. The items are displayed as individual rows : each row has a thumbnail icon, item short description and "shipped" and "ordered" quantities. If the item is shipped in multiple shipments, then the "shipped" quantity will be less than the "ordered" quantity. In desktop and tablet form factors: These cards are independently scrollable. The items in the shipment section will display the first 50 items. If there are more than 50 items, the text "+ X items" is shown after the 50 items, where X is the difference between the total items shipped in the shipment and 50. In the mobile form factor: The two cards are not scrollable and will be expanded to take up the length of all items in these cards. (This is done to avoid a vertical scroll within an already scrollable page). The "Shipment activity" section is displayed right after the items in the shipment section. The third panel can either contain a marketing iframe or a shipment panel. If there is only 1 shipment, then the third panel will display a marketing iframe, allowing retailers to use the space to market their products. If there are equal to or more than 2 shipments, then the third panel will list all shipments. In version2 UI, the parcel-packages present in "Other Items in Order" will be moved to the third panel's shipments section. When a shipment is selected, the first panel and the first card of the second panel, listing items in shipment, will be updated to display data for the selected shipment. Note: The Version2 UI, optimized for B2B Shipment Tracking, can be used for B2C orders and, in fact, might be more suitable for large B2C orders. Embedding Custom Panels in the Shipment Tracking Page Two custom iFrame panels can be embedded in the Shipment Tracking page, to add brand-specific content. Custom content for the iFrame windows should be responsive, so that the content can be viewed in desktop, tablet, or mobile form factors. Currently, only the three-column layout is supported; Custom iFrame implementation is mandatory. One URL per organization can be configured, so each organization can have unique content. The parameters OrderId, OrderToken, and OrgId are passed to the iFrames and can be used to query relevant APIs (like get Order) to retrieve additional information that might be needed. Here are some sample screenshots of custom panels embedded in the desktop, tablet, and mobile form factors. Note that as the screen width decreases, the custom panels are displayed below the out of the box widgets. The iFrame dimensions are as follows: Height = 35 rem The base iFrame height is 35 rem, but can be updated through the CSS variable: @media screen and (max-width: 767px) { --tracking-iframe-1: 35rem; --tracking-iframe-2: 35rem; } Width = Dynamic based on the form factor, using a bootstrap layout Iframe 1 : <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4> Iframe 2: <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12> The content within the iFrames should be responsive for a variety of device widths. See example iFrame widths based on some sample devices below. Device Browser width Browser height Iframe 1 width Iframe 1 height Iframe 2 width Iframe 2 height Mac Desktop 1920 1080 380 560 1140 560 iPhone X 375 812 345 560 345 560 iPad 375 1024 720 560 720 560 Refer to the below sample code for examples. Sample iFrame 1: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /> <link rel="stylesheet" href="<%=htmlWebpackPlugin.files.chunks.tracking.css %>"> </head> <body class="p-0 m-0 d-flex justify-content-center"> <div class="row m-0"> <div class="col-12 p-0"> <img class="rounded mx-auto img-fluid d-sm-none d-md-block" src='./assets/img/iframe-portrait.png' alt="iframe1 portrait" /> <img class="rounded mx-auto img-fluid d-none d-sm-block d-md-none" src='./assets/img/iframe-landscape.png' alt="iframe1 landscape" /> </div> </div> </body> </html> Sample iFrame 2: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 shrink-to-fit=no"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="<%=htmlWebpackPlugin.files.chunks.tracking.css %>"> </head> <body class="p-0 m-0"> <div class="text-dark"> <h2>Complete the look..</h2> <div class="row m-0"> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3 p-sm-2"> <div class="col-12 iframe2-1"> </div> <div class="col-12"> <h5>Cozy Sweater</h5> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3 p-sm-2"> <div class="col-12 iframe2-2"></div> <div class="col-12"> <h5>Cropped Boot Jean Comfort Stretch Comfort</h5> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3 p-sm-2"> <div class="col-12 iframe2-3"></div> <div class="col-12"> <h5>Croc Mules</h5> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3 p-sm-2"> <div class="col-12 iframe2-4"></div> <div class="col-12"> <h5>Tapered Pant</h5> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html> How to Configure Custom Panels Navigate to the Digital Self-Service UI Config menu option Add an entry Select Page = Shipment Tracking and Layout = Three Column In the Block Configuration Tab, add a new entry For the first custom panel, select Widget Type = iFrame and Block = FirstRowThirdColumn, and input the URL of your custom content (Note: For testing purposes, custom-iframe-sample-1.html can be used) For the second custom panel, select Widget Type = iFrame and Block = SecondRowFirstColumn, and input the second URL of your custom content (Note: For testing purposes, custom-iframe-sample-2.html can be used) Once this configuration is saved, refresh your DSS shipment tracking page, and the changes should be reflected. No restart is required. Using iFrame Tags to Track Web Traffic Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) codes, or tracking tags, can be appended to your iFrame URL to track where website traffic comes from. Marketers use this data to determine the source of website traffic to attribute the success of marketing campaigns to specific pieces of content. When implementing your iFrames, consider adding UTM codes to your iFrame URL.s For example: https://<host>/<somepath>/custom-iframe-sample-1.html?localeId=fr&utm_campagin=Fall2021&utm_source=SelfService iFrames based on Locale Displaying iFrame content based on the customer's locale can be configured in multiple ways: using a static URL based on locale, or a URL with a locale URL parameter. Static URL based on locale (or having the locale as path variables) https://<host>/<somepath>/${localeId}/custom-iframe-sample-1.html Example 1: https://<host>/selfservice/ui/assets/static/fr/custom-iframe-sample-1.html https://<host>/<somepath>/custom-iframe-sample-${localeId}.html Example 2: https://<host>/selfservice/ui/assets/static/custom-iframe-sample-es.html https://<host>/<somepath>/custom-iframe-sample-${localeId}.html A URL with 'locale variables' as URL parameters With this approach, the customer can read the URL parameters using Javascript in the iFrame HTML page they have configured and can use that locale to perform the action. https://<host>/<somepath>/custom-iframe-sample-1.html?localeId=${localeId} Example: https://<host>/selfservice/ui/assets/static/custom-iframe-sample-1.html?localeId=${localeId} https://<host>/selfservice/ui/assets/static/custom-iframe-sample-1.html?localeId=fr Note: ${localeId} is case-sensitive and the only pre-defined variable currently supported. How to test: Follow the steps of block configuration and steps to test and replace the URLs mentioned with the ones below. For ‘First Row Third Column’ : https://{host}/selfservice/ui/assets/static/custom-iframe-sample-1.html?localeId=${localeId} or assets/static/custom-iframe-sample-1.html?localeId=${localeId} For ‘Second Row First Column' : https://{host}/selfservice/ui/assets/static/custom-iframe-sample-2-${localeId}.html or assets/static/custom-iframe-sample-2-${localeId}.html Feature Scope The following is not supported: Tracking shipments of archived orders Tracking shipments with carriers other than FedEx, UPS, or USPS, unless custom work is done to integrate with the carrier's tracking API Displaying the status of other items in the order; the shipment tracking page displays only the items/status in a single package. The status of additional items on the order are available by clicking the 'Order Details' button. How to Test Prerequisite: Include the DSS returns link in the outbound email/text message, e-commerce site, etc. After completing all required configuration for shipment tracking: Place an order which gets allocated and released; ensure your order.customerEmail is a valid email address that you can access Ship the order with a valid carrierCode and trackingNumber in the order event message, for example: Use any valid test tracking number for the 3rd party carrier you're testing. You can also use a real tracking number, if you have one. { "OrderEvent": [ { "EventTypeId": "Ship", "ReleaseId": "EC_Dec12_031", "ReleaseLineId": "1", "Item": "Tops-13153-White-L", "Quantity": 8, "UOM": "U", "FulfillmentInfo": { "PackageId": "LPN_001", "TrackingNumber": "1Z12345E0205271688", "CarrierCode": "UPS", "EventDate": "2018-11-30T00:00:00" } } ] } From the shipment confirmation email/text, or e-commerce site, click the track shipment link to launch DSS. To test directly in the browser, without an email/text: Form a URL by filling in the below blue attributes with values from your shipped order: https://<applicationURL>/selfservice/ui/app/tracking?orderId=<orderId>&trackingId=<fulfillmentDetail.trackingNumber>&carrierCode=<fulfillmentDetail.carrierCode>&orgId=<order.organization>&token=<order.orderToken> Use a web browser, phone, or phone simulator such as xCode to launch this URL.
