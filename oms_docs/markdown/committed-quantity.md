This is useful when the lead time is unusually long for a source and to remove some specialty orders from the on-order quantities, if you want to make sure that the available inventory balance is not changed by the purchase. The committed quantity indicates the amount of item that is unavailable. The Types of Committed Quantities are: Back Order &ndash;&nbsp;The quantity on a customer&#39;s backorder is either manually entered or interfaced (inventory on customer backorder).&nbsp; On Reserve &ndash; The quantity is unavailable because of a special purpose that is either manually entered or interfaced (inventory being reserved for a special requirement, typically a planned shipment to a customer). Hold Out &ndash;&nbsp; The quantity unavailable typically because of a date-driven special purpose or because of long lead times for an item ordered from an alternate supplier (inventory being held out of normal cycle stock for some special purpose). There are two ways of committed quantity. Static Committed Quantity : Static Committed Quantity is configured at the item location level, such as Back Order quantity, ReserveQuantity, HoldOutQuantity and HoldOutDays and is valid at all the time unless the user deletes.&nbsp; Time Phased Committed Quantity :&nbsp;When a committed quantity is time-phased, it can be specified with details like CommittedQuantityId, Description, CommittedQuantityType, days indicator, and begin and end dates.&nbsp; The committed quantity is active for current business dates and for future dates that will be determined by the business date until it reaches those dates. The majority of customers will use Time Phased&nbsp;committed quantity&nbsp;within the date range. Use the committed quantity as the driver to trigger the order for inactive items that are not actually forecasted and replenished and need to fulfill a customer order. In general, for an inactive item, the SOQ will be generated when a committed&nbsp;quantity has been introduced. For the Active Items, the on hand is going below the out of stock, in that situation there is not enough inventory, you will have the estimated loss sales. Therefore,&nbsp;if a customer can use estimated or interface loss sales overall and if the item on hand goes to 0, the customer will incur some loss sales. This means that&nbsp;when the customer enters the store, there will not be enough inventory,&nbsp;resulting in a loss sales, and&nbsp;they are not able to fulfill their customer orders in those situations.

Based on the current business date, fetch the applicable time phased and static committed quantity applicable for the date.&nbsp; Use the reserve quantity to set aside inventory as a committed quantity so that Replenishment calculates replenishment SOQs over and above the quantity on reserve. Use holdouts to hold inventory out of your inventory position for a specified time frame. &nbsp; Order Factors &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without&nbsp; Committed Quantities&nbsp; With Committed Quantities &nbsp; Weekly Forecast 70 70 Daily Average 10 10 Safety Stock 50 50 Next Lead Time 20 20 Review Cycle 70 70 On Hand 20 20 On Order&nbsp; 10 10 Order Upto Level &nbsp; (Safety Stock + Next Lead Time + Max(Review Cycle,Joint Order Cycle, Economic Order Cycle) 140 140 Static Committed Quantity 0 120 Time Phased Committed Quantity&nbsp; 0 130 Inventory Position &nbsp; On Hand + On Order &ndash; Committed&nbsp;&nbsp;(Static+Time Phased) 30 - 220 SOQ&nbsp;&nbsp;(Order Up to Level - inventory Position) &nbsp; 110 360 &nbsp; Note:&nbsp;The inventory position is a negative value if the committed quantity is larger than the sum of the On Hand and On Order quantities.
