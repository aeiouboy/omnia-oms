A primary allocator can be assigned for supplies from a DC and the co-allocator teams responsible for the multiple destination locations can also be configured as a part of the allocator assignment. Co-allocators from all the teams responsible for the DC supply need to review and submit the allocations for approval. Process Flow Create Users: Create users with allocator or&nbsp;manager privileges. Details Create Teams: Create teams of allocators and managers responsible for the respective destination location categories. Details Allocator Assignment: Create an allocator assignment with a primary allocator responsible for supplies from a DC. &nbsp;Assign co-allocator teams for the destination location category in the Allocator assignment. This is an optional step. Details Teams can be setup at the location&nbsp;hierarchy level configured by the users. (Example: Region/District etc).&nbsp;Details Allocation Review and Submission: Co-allocators from all the teams responsible for the supply need to review and submit the allocated supply for any further action to be taken on it. A supply will be in partial submit status when the first co-allocator team member has submitted till the submission by the last co-allocator team. On submission by all co-allocator teams, the supply changes to submitted status. When co-allocator teams are not configured, the primary allocator responsible for the DC supply will review and submit the allocations for approval. Allocation Approval: Allocation managers will review and approve the submitted allocations.&nbsp; Allocation Release: Allocators will release the approved allocations.&nbsp; &nbsp; Configurations &nbsp; How to Create a User Users can be created using UI or API: Create User API: Sample Json: Create Allocators{{url}}/organization/api/organization/user/save{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;UserId&quot;: &quot;Allocator_1&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;PrimaryOrgId&quot;: &quot;pfioorg&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;UserName&quot;: &quot;Allocator_1&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;PasswordExpiry&quot;: -1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;IsActive&quot;: true, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;UserType&quot;: { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;UserTypeId&quot;: &quot;Human&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;IdentityType&quot;: { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;IdentityTypeId&quot;: &quot;Database&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;UserTimeZone&quot;: &quot;UTC&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;UserLocale&quot;: { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LocaleId&quot;: &quot;en&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Address&quot;: { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Peters&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Address1&quot;: &quot;1100&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Address2&quot;: &quot;Parkway&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Address3&quot;: &quot;First Floor&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;City&quot;: &quot;Atlanta&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;ajohn@manh.com&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;State&quot;: &quot;Georgia&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;PostalCode&quot;: &quot;30339&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Country&quot;: &quot;US&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } } &nbsp; How to Create Teams Teams can be created using UI Configuration for Location Hierarchy and Level for Team Assignment Sample Json: Location Hierarchy For Team Assignment{{url}}/ai-allocation/api/ai-allocation/allocationConfig/save { &quot;ConfigId&quot;: &quot;AllocatorAssignmentLocationHierarchyId&quot;, &quot;ConfigValue&quot;: &quot;Primary&quot; } &nbsp; &nbsp; Location Hierarchy Level For Team Assignment{{url}}/ai-allocation/api/ai-allocation/allocationConfig/save { &quot;ConfigId&quot;: &quot;AllocatorAssignmentLocationHierarchyLevel&quot;, &quot;ConfigValue&quot;: &quot;District&quot; } &nbsp; &nbsp; Allocator Assignment and Team Assignment Allocator Assignment UI Allocator Assignment can be specified using UI or APIs &nbsp; Sample Json: Allocation Assignment - Team Assignment{{url}}/ai-allocation/api/ai-allocation/allocatorAssignment/save{ &nbsp; &quot;ProductHierarchyFilter&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;DepartmentId\&quot;:\&quot;d1\&quot;,\&quot;ClassId\&quot;:\&quot;c1\&quot;,\&quot;SubclassId\&quot;:\&quot;sb11\&quot;}&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;ProductHierarchyFilterHash&quot;:&quot;d6846e685c933edae1c5652482ee1f4&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;HierarchyLevel1Value&quot;:&quot;l1234&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;LocationId&quot; : &quot;s2234&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;AllocatorId&quot; : &quot;Sri2234&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;AllocatorTeamAssignment&quot;: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LocationHierarchyLevel1Value&quot;: &quot;loc1&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LocationHierarchyLevel2Value&quot;: &quot;loc1&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;TeamId&quot;: &quot;team2234&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LocationHierarchyHash&quot;: &quot;loc234&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } } &nbsp; &nbsp; Implementation Flavors &nbsp; Team Structure in Implementation &nbsp; Team setup in Allocator Assignment &nbsp; Submission Details &nbsp; Allocation Responsibility by Location Category Team 1 : Location category 1, Menswear Team 2 : Location category 2, Menswear Team 1 : Location category 1, Womenswear Team 2 : Location category 2, Womenswear &nbsp; Menswear DC1 Location category 1 : Team 1 Menswear DC1 Location category 2 : Team 2 Womenswear DC1 Location category 1 : Team 1 Womenswear DC1 Location category 2 : Team 2 One member from T1 and T2 should submit the allocations for respective location categories to update the supply status for Menswear.
