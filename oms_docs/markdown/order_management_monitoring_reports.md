They help users identify gaps where the orders have not reached the intended customers on time and take steps to bridge the gap. The following points are some of the key highlights of the report: Order Tracking: The Order Management Monitoring Reports allow warehouse managers to track and manage the customer's orders from multiple channels. These reports track orders in different stages of the order management process, such as order created, allocated, released in progress, picked, packed, fulfilled, returned, cancelled and back-ordered. Backorders: Backorder is when a product is ordered, but inventory is not available for allocation, then a back order gets created and might get bridged to the next available warehouse having inventory for that product. Some of the SCI reports include reports on the status of such orders. Payments and Invoices Tracking: These reports provide insights into open and out-of-balance invoices. They also include a list of transactions with failed settlements. Customer Experience: The Order Management Monitoring Reports facilitate proper tracking of orders that helps warehouse managers respond to customer queries and thereby deliver a better customer experience. You can access the Order Management Monitoring reports in IBM Cognos by navigating to Team Content > SCI Packaged Content > Reports > OMNI > Order Management > Monitoring Reports. Common Prompts The following table summarizes some of the common prompts of the Order Management Monitoring Reports: Prompt Name Description Order Type This prompt represents the type of orders, such as call center orders, e-commerce orders, return orders, etc. These order types are defined in the Enterprise Inventory component of MAO. Order Status The Order Creation Monitoring report of SCI includes the Order Status prompt, where retailers can select a list of order statuses such as Address verified, allocated, back-ordered, delivered, in process, picked, released, returned, return canceled, etc. Order Priority Some of the reports under the Order Management Monitoring reports include the Order Priority prompt. This prompt helps in returning data for orders with different priorities or no priority set. Order / Order Line Hold Reason An order can be on hold for different reasons, such as address verification failure, awaiting a ship to address, returning items pending, payment fraud, etc. Orders can also be on hold if there is a variation in the goods returned versus expected in terms of condition, items, or quantity. Some of the monitoring reports include this prompt to analyze the reasons for holding different orders. The following sections explain each report under the Order Management Monitoring Reports in detail.
