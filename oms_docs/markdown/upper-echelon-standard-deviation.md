A lower standard deviation signifies stable demand, while a higher standard deviation indicates more significant demand fluctuations. The Upper Echelon Standard Deviation extends this concept to higher-level locations, such as Distribution Centers (DCs) or Hub Stores, which support demand at multiple lower-level locations (like retail stores) and other demand channels (e.g., online). It offers a consolidated view of demand variability across various locations, helping businesses understand overall demand trends. This metric is critical for optimizing inventory management and improving supply chain efficiency. By analyzing the Upper Echelon Standard Deviation, businesses can make informed decisions about stock levels, enhance forecasting accuracy, reduce costs, mitigate risks, and better coordinate with suppliers. It provides valuable insights to ensure that inventory is managed effectively and that supply chain operations run smoothly. How does it impact Safety Stock calculation? &nbsp;Standard deviation of demand impacts how much stock is kept safely to ensure we can meet demand. With higher variability, more safety stock is needed. Standard Deviation Vs Safety Stock Low Demand Variability (Low Standard Deviation): In stable demand conditions, there is less uncertainty, and therefore, less safety stock is required. Reduced holding costs and simplified inventory management are possible. High Demand Variability (High Standard Deviation):&nbsp;When demand fluctuates significantly, a higher safety stock is necessary to buffer against unexpected surges or drops. This can lead to increased holding costs and a higher risk of overstocking or stockouts. Process Flow An Upper Echelon (UE) Demand is not forecasted and does not have any seasonal profile associated with it. Its standard deviation is calculated based on the shipments at the end of the week compared to the order projections that are received from the Lower Echelon (LE) Item Locations at the start of the week. A multi-echelon (ME) network can undergo various changes, such as the addition or closure of LE locations, supplier changes and manual forecast changes of LE Item Locations, which require the corresponding UE Item Location's variance to be adjusted proportionately. MASCP system supports Scaling Factor and Bull Whip Factor method for&nbsp;variance and standard deviation calculation. This is determined based on a configuration -&nbsp;"ueStdDevCalcOption". The Scaling Factor Method is the recommended method, detailed below. A Minimum Standard Deviation Percentage -&nbsp;20% of the sum of LE Deseasonalized forecast for the current week is used as a baseline variance for the first time calculation. Subsequently,&nbsp;adjust the UE Item Location's variance for the changes in the Multi-Echelon network by scaling it up or down based on aggregate period forecast changes of the LE child Item Locations. De-seasonalize the UE Item Location forecast error before smoothing it into the variance. As the UE Item Location cannot have its own seasonal profile, the seasonal index used for de-seasonalizing the error will be derived based on forecast projections of the LE child Item Locations. As the variance has already been adjusted for network changes, the smoothed variance will no longer be capped based on the bullwhip factor change threshold unless the&nbsp;"ueStdDevCalcOption" is set to "0" to use the Bullwhip factor. There is also an impact on UE Item Location's Safety Stock calculation. The UE Item Location's&nbsp;variance is adjusted&nbsp;for the changes in the Multi-Echelon network that may have happened after the period roll forecast update process. The projected variance over the exposure period of the UE Item Location is calculated,&nbsp;considering the seasonality as well as future changes expected in the Multi-Echelon network over the exposure period. This enables the safety stock of UE Item Location to take seasonality into account. &nbsp; Configuration The Upper Echelon Standard Deviation calculation relies on certain configurations within the system. Here's a list of elements that need to be configured: UeSkusStdDevCalcOption - Configuration Flag that determines the method used for Standard Deviation Calculation. If the value is '1', then the calculation uses the "Scaling Factor" method. If the value is '0', then the calculation uses the "Bull Whip Factor" method. UeSkusMinEffectiveSeasIndex - Configuration Flag that determines if the Standard Deviation needs to be updated for the current period roll Set to a default of 0.2. If the seasonal index falls lower than this, the standard deviation is not updated for the current period roll. EngineBullWhipFactor - Default Bull Whip Factor value, set to 1, used for the first time calculation.

UI Name Component Entity Item Location Analysis UI &gt;&gt; General &gt;&gt; Standard Deviation Inventory Optimization&nbsp; InventoryMovement Inventory Optimization&nbsp; UpperEchelonStandardDeviationHistory &nbsp; The Standard Deviation widget in Item Location Analysis UI &gt;&gt; General Tab provides the calculated standard deviation for the given Item Location. For a LE Item Location, it shows&nbsp;the forecast calculated standard deviation units and percentage. For a UE Item Location, it shows the calculated standard deviation based on an aggregated LE forecast and shipments from the UE location. This UE standard deviation value can be manually edited and used until the system recomputes&nbsp;in the next period roll.
