For example, a store may have difficulty fulfilling online orders, so inventory for that store must&nbsp;be excluded in enterprise inventory visibility.&nbsp;The accuracy of inventory availability only improves when a retailer can filter or constrain the views of enterprise inventory, which is presented and promised in any commerce channel. Manhattan Available to Commerce&nbsp;(ATC) is a promising engine that applies rules to Manhattan Enterprise Inventory - enabling retailers to create views of inventory availability in accordance with business goals and operational constraints. ATC&nbsp;ensures&nbsp;retailers with the inventory presented in any given commerce channel that meets customer expectations and business needs. Retailers can state&nbsp;and reconfigure inventory availability views considering a range of factors such as, selling channel, retail brand, delivery method, seasonality, store capacity/capability, inventory accessibility, inventory disposition, and safety stock levels.&nbsp;ATC publishes all inventory availability information to the appropriate&nbsp;commerce channels while considering&nbsp;any capacity constraints or store outages. Using the availability rules, commerce&nbsp;controls the amount of supply available to every commerce channel.&nbsp;The output of a commerce view is commerce availability (available quantity and availability status), which represents the pool of inventory available for that corresponding commerce channel.
