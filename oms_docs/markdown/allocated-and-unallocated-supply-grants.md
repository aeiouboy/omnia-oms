They essentially assign permissions or access rights to specific roles, allowing them to perform certain tasks or utilize particular resources. Grants are utilized to allocate resources to roles within an organization. This ensures that individuals in designated roles have the necessary permissions to carry out their responsibilities effectively. For example, an allocator role has permission to approve supply, so they are assigned the approved supply resource via a grant. Grants can be managed through the organization&#39;s interface or via the User Roles UI. This provides flexibility in how grants are imported, configured, and managed within the system. Grants are often linked to the user&#39;s position within the organizational hierarchy. For instance, if a user has access to multiple locations within the organization, grants associated with their position in the parent organization of the chosen location will apply. This ensures that access rights are appropriately scoped based on organizational structure and user roles. &nbsp; &nbsp; Menu Name Resource Allocator Manager Unallocated Supplies aiui::facade::menu::unallocatedSupplies Yes Yes Allocated Supplies aiui::facade::menu::allocatedSupplies Yes Yes Allocator Console aiui::facade::menu::allocatorConsole Yes Yes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UI Name Action/Buttons Resource Allocator Manager Unallocated Supplies Recalculate aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::recalculate Yes Yes Unallocated Supplies Modify Method aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::modifymethod Yes Yes Unallocated Supplies Delete Overstock Supply aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::deleteOverstockSupply Yes Yes Unallocated Supplies Evaluate Transfer aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::evaluateTransfers Yes Yes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UI Name Action/Buttons Resource Allocator Manager Allocated Supplies Recalculate aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::recalculate Yes Yes Allocated Supplies Modify Method aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::modifymethod Yes Yes Allocated Supplies Delete Overstock Supply aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::deleteOverstockSupply Yes Yes Allocated Supplies Evaluate Transfer aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::evaluateTransfers Yes Yes Allocated Supplies Edit By All Size aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::editByAllSize Yes Yes Allocated Supplies View By All Size aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::viewByAllSize Yes Yes Allocated Supplies View aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::view Yes Yes Allocated Supplies Submit aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::submitforapproval Yes Yes Allocated Supplies Approve aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::approve No Yes Allocated Supplies Release aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::release No Yes Allocated Supplies Reject aiui::aiui_allocation::allocation::reject No Yes &nbsp; &nbsp;
