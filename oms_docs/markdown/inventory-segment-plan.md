The allocation system will allocate the inventory for which a notification is received based on the expected demand at the respective stores and channels. After the allocators review and approve the allocations,&nbsp;the allocation system will send a notification back to the inventory management system about the percentage ratios in which the DC inventory should be segmented for the respective&nbsp;channels based on the planned allocations. &nbsp; Process Flow &nbsp; Inventory Update The inventory system will update the allocation system about the inventory update (New PO/ASN, On-hand change etc.).
