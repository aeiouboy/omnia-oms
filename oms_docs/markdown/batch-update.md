This is particularly useful when users need to update a common field for many records. These changes are processed as background tasks, enabling users to continue working while the system completes the updates. Process Flow The batch update process begins when the user initiates the action. First, the user creates filter criteria to select the relevant records that need to be updated. Once the records are filtered, the user selects the 'Batch Update' action. A pop-up window then appears, displaying the list of attributes that are available for batch updates. The user enters the new values for the appropriate attributes and submits the batch update request. The system's batch update API then processes this request by applying the provided attribute values to all records that match the filter criteria. After the update is completed, the user is notified of the successful completion of the batch update, marking the end of the process. &nbsp; The Item Location screen offers a&nbsp;Batch Update feature that enables users to update multiple records for the attributes listed below. &nbsp; Section &nbsp; Attributes &nbsp; Header Primary Source General Attributes Life Cycle Status Id Activation Date Deactivation Date Buying Multiple Buying Multiple Buying Multiple RoundUp Percent Buying Multiple UOM Manual Minimum Minimum Minimum Days Minimum Quantity Confidence Manual Minimum Type Use Minimum Days Manual Maximum Maximum Maximum Days Maximum Quantity Confidence Manual Maximum Type Use Maximum Days Committed qty Back Order Quantity Reserve Quantity Hold Out Quantity Hold Out Days Order Point Adjustment Order Point Adjustment Days Order Point Minimum Quantity Service Investment Strategy Velocity Code &nbsp; Implementation Flavors N/A UIs and Entities N/A Services N/A &nbsp; Troubleshooting N/A Related Articles Item Location DeactivationOrder GroupBulk Update Constrained Supply AllocationMaximum Economic Order Cycle DaysPlanogramLead Time ForecastingCalendar Build Pattern and ExceptionReplenishment - OverviewHub and SpokeSOQ ComputationNew Store ModelingBreak Point Pricing
