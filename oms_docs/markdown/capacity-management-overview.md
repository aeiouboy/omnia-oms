This is expected to be a quantitative value and any order that is created to consume capacity will go through capacity management. Capacity is required to monitor the backlog of orders and ensure the location is not overloaded and orders are allocated optimally for those locations with ability to fulfill the orders. Capacity also plays a role in maintaining and publishing availability view. A view can choose to bring down location with full capacity.
