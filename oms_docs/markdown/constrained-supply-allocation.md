When DC inventory is insufficient to meet store needs and additional supply is not feasible, Constrained Supply Allocation ensures efficient inventory distribution based on certain factors like store priority, committed quantities, and demand factors etc. Key Benefits: Ensures efficient distribution of constrained inventory based on factors at destination location. Helps prioritize inventory allocation to high-priority stores. Reduces stockouts and improves fulfillment accuracy. Process Flow Inventory Update Notification: The inventory system will notify the Supply Chain Planning system when there is an update to source or destination locations. Evaluate Constrained Supply situation based on available inventory: The Supply Chain Planning (SCP) system will evaluate if there is a constrained supply situation at the DC. SCP will compare available DC Inventory with all the stores' needs. If DC inventory is less than the sum of all store needs, it is a constrained supply situation. Constrained Supply Allocation: If there is a constrained inventory situaltion at the source location and if the source location is configured to support Constrained Supply Allocation, inventory will be allocated to destination stores based on various factors listed below and store SOQs will be updated. Users can see Original SOQ (Unconstrained SOQ) and Final SOQ (Constrained SOQ) in replenishment output screens like the Suggested Order Lines, Item Location Analytics and SOQ Insights Screen. If DC is not configured to support constrained supply allocation, store SOQs will not be updated as per the constrained inventory and the final and original SOQ will be the same. Order Build: The Order Build process will use the new store SOQs computed by the system as a part of constrained supply allocation. Order Approval & Generation: Orders will be approved and sent to the execution system to allocate inventory from DC to stores. Examples: Example 1 : Constrained allocation - No Committed Quantity for Stores Data setup: DC1- Store 1 DC1- Store 2 No Store Priority specified DC : Inventory Position = 50 Original Store SOQ Final Store SOQ Store 1 100 25 Store 2 100 25 Example 2 : Constrained allocation. Constrained supply flag on DC = False Data setup: DC1- Store 1 DC1- Store 2 Store 1 : Priority 1 Store 2 : Priority 2 DC : Inventory Position = 50 Original Store SOQ Final Store SOQ Store 1 100 100 Store 2 100 100 Example 3 : Constrained allocation based on Committed Quantity, Constrained supply flag on DC = True. Data setup: DC1- Store 1 DC1- Store 2 DC1 - Store 3 Store 1 : Committed Quantity = 100 Store 2 : Committed Quantity = 50 Store 3: Committed Quantity = 0 DC : Inventory Position = 150 Original Store SOQ Final Store SOQ Store 1 100 100 Store 2 100 50 Store 3 100 0 Example 4 : Constrained allocation based on Service Level and Buying Multiple Data setup: DC1- Store 1. Buying Multiple 15, Service Level = 99% DC1- Store 2, Buying Multiple 1, Service Level = 90% DC : Inventory Position = 50 Original Store SOQ Final Store SOQ Store 1 100 30 Store 2 100 20 Example 5 : Recalculating Order after constrained supply allocation Data setup: DC1- Store 1 DC1- Store 2 Store 1 : Committed Quantity = 10 Store 2 : Committed Quantity = 10 DC : Inventory Position = 50 Original Store SOQ Final Store SOQ Store 1 100 25 Store 2 100 25 Recalculate SOQ : On user confirmation, frozen SOQs are recalculated Original Store SOQ Final Store SOQ Store 1 100 100 Store 2 100 100 Factors Used in Constrained Supply Allocation Factor Description Impact on Allocation DC Inventory Total inventory at the DC for the item minus the committed quantity at the DC is available to fulfil the store needs (SOQ). DC need to have configuration enabled to support the constrained inventory allocation. Committed Quantity Existing Store commitment to fulfill the inventory for special purposes. This inventory is not considered available for general sale. The higher the value of these factors at the store, the higher the store's priority in allocation. Exposure Period Demand Store Demand for Lead Time + Review Cycle for the relationship. Safety Stock Safety stock for the store. Remainder of SOQ Unfulfilled SOQ for the store. Buying Multiple Buying multiple for the Item Location. Constrained allocation will be done in terms of the buying multiple. Configurations Set the 'Constrained Allocation Enabled' flag turned on for the source location (DC or store) for which constrained supply allocation should be enabled. UI Link : {Url}/scp/screen/itemlocation/Locations Note : If the user cancels the recalculate action, final SOQs for destination stores are unchanged.
