Replenishment calculates appropriate amounts of safety stock for each item location based on the following components: Service level goal Standard deviation of demand Lead time and lead time deviation Forecast Review cycle and joint order cycle Manual minimum (out of stock point type) Buying multiple and minimum purchase quantity &nbsp; Why is Safety Stock Important? To ensure that your company&rsquo;s service levels are met, the correct amount of safety stock must be a part of each Item Location Order calculation. Replenishment calculates the appropriate amount of safety stock for each item location when you effectively manage the safety stock components. Safety stock can represent a significant percentage of your company&rsquo;s inventory&nbsp;investment. By managing the components appropriately, you can help your company optimize its safety stock investment. &nbsp; The higher this value&hellip; The impact on safety stock&hellip; Service Level Goal Safety Stock increases Standard Deviation of Demand Lead Time Lead Time Standard Deviation Review Cycle Forecast Joint Order Cycle Safety Stock decreases Buying Multiple Minimum Purchase Quantity &nbsp; Process Flow In the Compute SOQ process, Safety Stock is calculated based on several factors to ensure that enough inventory is available to cover demand fluctuations during the Lead Time (LT). Here&#39;s how the process works: Lead Time (LT) &ndash; The time it takes for an order to be fulfilled from the moment it&rsquo;s placed. Longer lead times typically result in higher safety stock levels to mitigate the risk of stockouts during delays. Standard Deviation (Std Dev) &ndash; Represents the variability in demand or supply. A higher standard deviation indicates more variability, leading to the need for more safety stock to buffer against uncertainty. Standard Deviation Percentage (Std Dev%) &ndash; This is used to calculate the variability in demand during the lead time, helping to determine the required safety stock. Forecast &ndash; If a forecast is available, it helps predict demand during the lead time. If no forecast is provided, safety stock is typically considered zero, assuming no predictable demand fluctuations. Safety Stock Calculation Safety stock is calculated using the lead time, standard deviation of demand, and forecast data. The formula typically involves multiplying the standard deviation of demand during the lead time by a z-score (which represents the desired service level) to determine the buffer stock needed. Triggering SOQ Calculation Whenever there&rsquo;s a Forecast Update (FU) or Forecast Input (FI), the SOQ calculation is triggered. This means that the safety stock is recalculated to ensure inventory levels remain adequate based on the updated demand forecast, lead time, and variability. In summary, the safety stock helps buffer against uncertainties in lead time and demand. Whenever forecast data is updated or new inputs are provided, the system recalculates the SOQ and adjusts safety stock levels accordingly to maintain optimal inventory levels. &nbsp; Troubleshooting NA Related Articles Item Relationship Network View and User AccessUpper Echelon Standard DeviationService Investment StrategiesSCP ConfigurationsMulti-Echelon Service Investment StrategyOrder Frequency Simulation
