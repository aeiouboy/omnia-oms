Previously, future inventory projections were based primarily on general inventory levels, which could lead to inaccurate planning. With this update, the system uses precise inbound supply data to provide a more accurate view of future stock availability. By providing a clearer and more precise picture of future inventory, this feature enables businesses to: Make smarter, data-driven purchasing decisions Minimize the risk of stockouts or excess inventory Enhance customer satisfaction through accurate product availability timelines Refine replenishment planning with better visibility into incoming supply Use case: Accurately predict future On-hand inventory levels. Calculating precise On-Order quantities based on expected receipts. Generating reliable Receipt projections for better planning. Optimizing your supply chain by considering actual inbound delivery dates. Process Flow &nbsp; This process involves several key stages, from initial inventory updates to the final calculation of your order projections. The overall flow begins with changes to your expected inventory, moves through an optimization phase where these changes are processed, and finally culminates in the replenishment calculations that generate your projections. 1. Inventory Update (Initial Trigger) -&nbsp;This represents any change to your inventory status or expected inbound supply. It's the starting point for the entire projection process. These updates can be triggered by various operational activities within your supply chain. 2. Inventory Optimization (Processing Supply Changes) -&nbsp; Once an inventory update occurs, the system moves to the "Inventory Optimization" phase where specific types of incoming supply changes are processed. These are critical for affecting your future inventory projections: PO Update (Qty Change/ETA Change/Cancellation): This refers to any modification made to an existing Purchase Order (PO). Quantity Change: The number of items on the PO is increased or decreased. ETA Change: The Expected Delivery Date for the PO is adjusted, indicating an earlier or later arrival. Cancellation: The entire Purchase Order is cancelled, meaning the expected supply will no longer be received. ASN Create: An Advance Ship Notice (ASN) is generated. This is a notification from a supplier indicating that goods have been shipped and providing details about the shipment (e.g., contents, quantities, and ETA). ASN Update (Qty change/ETA Change) - Modifications to an existing ASN. This could involve changes to the quantity of items originally noted in the ASN or an update to its Expected Delivery Date. PO/ASN Cancellation -&nbsp;This specifically highlights operations where an entire open Purchase Order or Advance Ship Notice is cancelled, effectively removing the associated quantity from expected future supply. PO/ASN Short Shipment - This occurs when a shipment arrives with fewer items than originally specified on the PO or ASN. The system processes this to reduce the expected incoming quantity to reflect the actual partial receipt, often marking the remaining unreceived quantity as zero. 3. Process Supply Changelistener (The Information Hub) All updates and changes occurring within the "Inventory Optimization" phase are captured by the "Process Supply ChangeListener." This component acts as a central detection mechanism. It continuously "listens" for any of the PO or ASN-related events. Once detected, it funnels this updated supply information downstream to the replenishment calculation engine. 4. Replenishment (Calculating Future Projections) The information from the "Process Supply ChangeListener" directly feeds into the "Replenishment" calculations, specifically initiating the calculation of future order quantities. This section is where the system builds a detailed picture of your expected inventory over time. Calculate the Future Order Quantity Array: The system takes the updated supply data (from the Supply ChangeListener) and compiles it into a time-phased array. This array represents the expected incoming quantities for each future period (e.g., day, week). It's a granular view of when and how much is expected to arrive. Build SKU with the POLines (EDD and OrderQty): As part of constructing the future order quantity array, the system meticulously processes information for each individual item (SKU). For every SKU, it identifies all associated Purchase Order Lines, taking into account their Expected Delivery Date (EDD) and the ordered quantity (OrderQty). This step ensures that the calculations are based on specific, detailed item and delivery information. Calculate OrderProjections with "use.edd.in.order.projections": This is the final step where the comprehensive order projections are generated. The system uses all the aggregated and time-phased incoming quantity information (from the "Future Order Quantity Array" and the SKU-level detail). Crucially, this step incorporates the "use.edd.in.order.projections" configuration setting. When this setting is enabled, the system uses the detailed Expected Delivery Dates from your POs and ASNs to create highly accurate "On-Hand," "On-Order," and "Receipt" projections. Configurations: Configuration Flags: use.edd.in.order.projections: Controls inclusion of ETA dates. treat.onOrder.as. OnHand: Converts on-order quantities to on-hand if enabled. &nbsp; Examples: Example 1: OUTL = 14 days PO ETA = 13 days If high demand is expected in the first 10 days, the PO supply on day 13 will only support 1 day, potentially leading to a stockout. Systems can flag this using future enhancements. Example 2: On 4/8, OH = 100, PO1 = 40 qty (ETA 4/2), PO2 = 30 qty (ETA 4/12), PO3 = 20 qty (ETA 4/24) Projections include PO1 and PO2 if within OUTL; PO3 is excluded.
