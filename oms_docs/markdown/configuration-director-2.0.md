Config Director 2.0 has precise control at the profile and entity level, providing an additional layer of control and flexibility. Note: In CD 1.0, we only had the ability to specify the components and purposes that we wanted to include, which sometimes unintentionally led to the inclusion of L1 profile information (such as items) and L0 entities (such as message queues) during exports and imports. Configuration Director 2.0 has reduced reliance on direct calls to components, opting for a queue-based approach. Queues are used to ensure that even if a component is temporarily unavailable, it is given time to become operational, preventing it from being excluded from the activity. The following are the data portability capabilities of Configuration Director 2.0: Enables data portability at a profile level for control over exports, imports, and compare. Exports data for a single profile ID at a time Imports data into a single profile ID at a time Provides a user-interactive comparison feature with the capability to drill down individual record-level differences between compared data. Enables individual data level imports from the UI. Optionally enables data deletion during import. Move configurations and master data between environments such as stage and production. Exports can be downloaded, uploaded, and imported across environments. It is an asynchronous tool which does not bypass an unavailable component when export/import/compare is triggered. The User Interface The following User Interface elements are used in Configuration Director 2.0: Navigation Bar Header Export Panel Import Panel Compare Panel Export, Import and Compare List Panel Component List Panel Entity List Panel Comparison Result Summary Panel Comparison Result Drill Down Export, Import and Compare Data entry Pop-up Action Buttons Home Page and Navigation Bar Header To access Configuration Director 2.0: 1.

Component-Level Exclusion Property: fwee.component.excluded.entities Scope: Specific to an individual component. Format: A comma-separated list of entity names. Purpose: Excludes specific entities from processing within a single component. Example Configuration: fwee.component.excluded.entities=Facility,Order Effect: The entities Facility and Order will be excluded only within the component where this property is defined. Framework/Application-Level Exclusion Property: fwee.framework.excluded.entities Scope: Applies across all components within the application/framework. Format: A comma-separated list of entity names. Purpose: Excludes specific entities globally across all components. Example Configuration: fwee.framework.excluded.entities=ExtensionHandler,EventStrategy Effect: The entities ExtensionHandler and EventStrategy will be excluded globally across all components in the application. Environment Variable-Based Exclusion Environment Variable: profile.based.components.ignore Scope: Applies globally across the system via the configuration sync. Purpose: Allows exclusion of specific components dynamically using an environment variable. Example Configuration: export profile.based.components.ignore=ComponentA,ComponentB Effect: The components ComponentA and ComponentB will be excluded system-wide. Comparison Table Property/Variable Scope Level Format Example Values fwee.component.excluded.entities Component Local to Component Comma-separated list Facility,Order fwee.framework.excluded.entities Framework Global Comma-separated list ExtensionHandler,EventStrategy profile.based.components.ignore Environment Global via Env Var Comma-separated list ComponentA,ComponentB Key Notes Use fwee.component.excluded.entities for targeted exclusions at the component level. Use fwee.framework.excluded.entities for broader exclusions across all components. Use profile.based.components.ignore for dynamic, environment-level exclusions. This setup allows flexibility in managing exclusions across different layers of your application. Note: Refer to Manhattan ProActive®, a tool to help customize the product and manage extensions. Export Functionality in Configuration Director (CD) 2.0 The Export functionality in Configuration Director (CD) 2.0 allows users to efficiently extract configuration data from specific environments, ensuring secure and flexible management of configuration assets. Overview of Export Functionality Purpose: Seamlessly extract configuration data from a specific environment. Master Data Export (Optional): Supports exporting associated master data for a profile. Use caution and best judgement while selecting this option. Granularity: Operates at the profile level, aligning with principles of granular data management. Data Integrity: Maintains profile-specific integrity during export operations. Export Scope: Users can customize exports based on Components, Entities, Profile Purposes, and Profile Purpose Functional Groups. Profile-Level Export Design Profile as a Logical Container: Configuration data resides in Profiles, which serve as logical data containers. Independent Management: Each profile's data is managed and exported independently. Precision Control: Users gain fine-grained control over exported configurations. ExportID: Every export operation generates a unique ExportId for tracking purposes. Levels of Export Filtering Components Description: Components represent higher-level building blocks of an organization’s configuration. Selection: UI: Components can be added directly through the user interface. Backend (API): Excluding specific components requires setting them in the property for exclusion. Flexibility: Dual approach ensures flexibility in managing component-level configurations. Scope: Only components listed in the organization component for seeded profile purposes are considered during export. Entities Description: Entities are assets containing the configuration data within a selected component. Selection: UI: Entities can be added directly through the UI dropdown menu. Backend (API): Exclusions are managed via setting them in the property for exclusion. Granularity: Allows users to finely control which entities are included or excluded. Profile Purposes Description: Profile purposes represent specific objectives tied to profiles. Selection: The dropdown menu lists all seeded profile purposes. Advanced selection via Regex Patterns (e.g., org::*, *::messaging). Regex Usage: While regex is not supported in the UI dropdown, it can be applied manually via Export APIs. Flexibility: Allows pattern-based inclusion of profile purposes for complex export scenarios. Profile Purpose Functional Groups Description: Logical grouping of profile purposes. These are seeded and can also be user-created. Selection: When a functional group is selected, only the associated profile purposes are exported. Abstraction: Provides a higher-level grouping for managing related profile purposes collectively. Simplification: Reduces manual effort in selecting individual profile purposes. Export Workflow Summary Select Profile: Choose the profile you want to export. Filter by Components: Add components via the UI or exclude via API. Filter by Entities: Choose entities from dropdown or manage exclusions via API. Filter by Profile Purposes: Use dropdown or regex (via API). Filter by Functional Groups: Select functional groups for collective export. Initiate Export: Trigger the export process. Receive ExportId: A unique ExportId is generated for tracking and reference. Download Export Data: Exported configuration can be downloaded in a zip file. Key Highlights Granular export control through Components, Entities, Profile Purposes, and Functional Groups. Backend API support for advanced inclusion/exclusion logic. Regex support for complex profile purpose selection (via API). Ensures data integrity by managing each profile independently. Unique ExportId for tracking and validation of export requests. The Export functionality in Configuration Director 2.0 ensures flexibility, precision, and scalability in managing configuration data across environments, making it a robust tool for enterprise configuration management. Note: Only components listed in the organization component for seeded profile purposes are picked up by Configuration Director 2.0. An Export ID is generated for each export request per environment. Export User Interface UI Field Description Functionality Color-coded Export Counter Indicates the number of exports in different states Users can click on a color-coded export counter to filter the export list by status. If the user clicks "Success", then only successful exports are listed. Export List Left most panel with list of exports This contains the list of exports in the selected date range which can be filtered by status using the color-coded export counters. Export identifier, date time of export and the export Ids are shown for each export on the respective export card. Users can click on an export card for a list of components which were part of the export. Green -Indicates successful export. Red -Indicates a failed export. Users can click on the failure icon to view the failure details. Download Icon -Download export data. Only a successful export can be downloaded on local systems. An export can be downloaded if data transformation is required. Post, modifications the data can be uploaded and later used for import or comparison. Yellow -Indicates an export in progress Components List of components in selected export Users can click on a component for a list of entities which were part of the export. Note: selecting any component using a check box automatically selects the related Export Id. Green - indicates successful export of the component. Red - Indicates a failure to export components. Yellow -Indicates an export in progress. Entities List of entities List entities in the selected component. Select/deselect to perform selective import. Green Icon -Indicates successful export of the entity. Red Icon -Indicates a failure to export an entity. Click to get more information Yellow -Indicates an export in progress Start Date, End Date Date filed to input the start date Date filed to input the end date By default, the date range is set to that of one day ending with the current date. Users can set any date range and click on the search icon to get results between the selected date range. The color-coded counter results also reflect the result within the date range selected. No eligible entity found for export Inclusion profile purpose: org::* and no other filters are selected When the Inclusion Profile purpose is configured with the purpose org::* and no additional filters are applied, the export process will consider all components. During the export, components that satisfy the criteria defined by the Inclusion Profile will be successfully exported. However, components that do not meet these criteria will be excluded from the export. For these excluded components, the system will display the message: "No eligible entity found for export" to indicate that they do not fulfill the necessary conditions for inclusion. The process ensures that only components and entities matching the filter criteria are exported, while non-eligible components are excluded effectively to maintain accuracy and efficiency. Similarly, we can exclude functional groups also. Export Actions New Export New Export action is used to trigger a new export from a profile by optionally providing filters to perform inclusion and/or exclusion. Step 1 Triggering a new export for the selected profileId and optionally filters can be applied to perform selective Export. UI Attribute Description Mandatory ProfileId Select from list of profile Id from accessible organizations to export Y Export Qualifier Unique identifier for the data to be exported N Profile Information Profile Ids from accessible organizations are listed which can be exported by the user. Additionally, the following profile Ids are also available to be exported. ProfileId Description UnknownProfile There are some configuration entities which are not profile based and with security scope as none. Generally, these are organization specific data which are not part of any profile. For such data “unknownProfile“ profile purpose is added to enable exporting them. Example:: User, Role,Location Triggering a new Export for the selected profile ID and, optionally, filters, can be applied to perform selective Export. UI Attribute Description Mandatory Profile Id Select from profile IDs from accessible organizations to export Y Export Qualifier Unique identifier for the data to be exported N Step 2 UI Attribute Description Notes Filter Criteria This is a field which allows users to save the parameters used for export as a filter which can be used later without manually setting up the parameters. The filters are organization-specific and can be reused. Once saved, it will be available for the user to select and apply. Export is performed based on what parameters are selected for export. Once a filter is selected, the user can override and use the overridden filters for export. Users can also add a note for a filter to describe it for reference. Use “Save Filter” Action to save a filter at anytime Export Master Data Select True if it is required to export Master data with Config data. Note: Some master data such as Item can be large, which will impact overall processing times. Select Profile Purposes to Export Profile Purpose A drop-down that lists the different profile purposes. Users can select a specific profile purpose if required, Entities only for the selected profile purposes are considered by the config director. Profile Purpose Functional Group A drop-down that lists the different profile purpose groups. Users can select a specific profile purpose group if required, Entities only for the profile purposes from the selected profile purpose group are considered by the config director. This is optional and if not selected, all profile purposes are considered by the Config Director. Lists of unique profile purposes are considered consolidated from a profile purpose and profile purpose group list. Select Components to Export Select components and optionally list entities for a component The configuration Director will not perform any data dependency checks while specific entities are exported to take care of any logical relationship. Exclusions Profile Purposes Profile Purpose Groups Custom Profile Component Entity A custom profile text box can be used to enter wildcard-based-profile purposes. Note: Exclusion takes precedence in case of conflicting inclusion and exclusion selection. Upcoming feature, not yet available. Import Functionality in Configuration Director (CD) 2.0 The Import functionality in Configuration Director (CD) 2.0 allows users to seamlessly bring configuration and optionally master data into a profile within a specific environment. It emphasizes granular control, profile-level precision, and robust backend flexibility for managing configuration imports effectively. Overview of Import Functionality Purpose: Import configuration data into a specific profile within an environment. Granularity: Operates at the profile level, aligning with profile-specific data integrity principles. Scope: Does not support importing the entire organization configuration in one operation. Data Storage: Imported data is fetched from the configured remote object store. ImportId: Each import operation generates a unique ImportId for tracking and auditing. Profile-Level Import Design Logical Container: Configuration data is structured within profiles, which act as logical containers. Precision Management: Each profile's configuration data is managed independently. Granular Control: Users can include/exclude data at Components, Entities, Profile Purposes, and Profile Purpose Functional Groups levels. Data Integrity: Ensures the integrity of the profile's unique dataset during the import process. Levels of Import Filtering Components Description: Components are high-level building blocks of configuration data. Selection: UI: Components included during export can be selectively imported through the UI. Backend (API): Adjustments and exclusions during export can still be managed through backend APIs during import. Flexibility: Offers precise control over component-level configurations during import. Scope: Only components listed in the organization component for seeded profile purposes are processed during import. Profile Purposes Description: Profile purposes represent specific objectives tied to profiles. Selection: Dropdown: Predefined profile purposes can be selected via the UI. Regex (API): Advanced users can employ regex patterns (e.g., org::*, *::messaging) to include specific profile purposes. Regex Handling: Regex-based imports must be performed via backend APIs, as the dropdown does not support regex patterns. Flexibility: Enables complex filtering scenarios for profile-specific configurations. Profile Purpose Functional Groups Description: Logical groupings of profile purposes which are seeded and user-created Selection: Functional groups selected during export can be consistently used during import. Aggregation: Ensures only relevant profile purposes tied to a functional group are imported. Simplification: Provides an efficient way to manage related profile purposes collectively. Entities Description: Entities are assets containing the configuration data within a selected component. Selection: UI: Entities included during export can be selected via dropdown during import. Backend (API): Excluded or adjusted entities can be managed via backend APIs. Visibility: The drop-down provides clear visibility into available entities for import.

Step 1 Triggering a new Import for the selected profileId, and optionally, filters can be applied to perform selective Import. UI Attribute Description Remark InputId This is an instance of an export or compare which is to be imported into the target environment. This is a mandatory field and is required to be provided by user. The Export Id , compare Id should exist before it is passed on as Input Id for import. This can be the identifier of an upload from another environment. Target ProfileId Unique profile Id from accessible profile Id to which the data will be imported Mandatory Import Qualifier Unique identifier for the data to be imported Mandatory Notes This is the text area which can be used by users to provide additional details against the import Optional and only used for informational purposes. Allow Delete This is an optional field to allow deleting data from target profile based on the difference found in the compare result. The field "Allow Delete" is conditioned by the property profile.based.import.allow.delete. This field will be enabled upon enabling the above property. Note: You can trigger a new Import for the selected profile ID and, optionally, filters can be applied to perform selective Import.

Step 2 UI Attribute Description Notes Filter Criteria This is a field which allows users to save the parameters used for import as a filter which can be used later without manually setting up the parameters. The filters are organization-specific and can be reused. Once saved, it will be available for the user to select and apply. The import is done based on what parameters are selected. Once a filter is selected, the user can override and use the overridden filters for import. Users can also add a note for a filter to describe it for reference. Use “Save Filter” Action to save a filter at anytime Import Master Data Select True if it is required to Import Master data with Config data. Note:: Some master data such as Item can be large, which will impact overall processing times. Select Profile Purposes to Import Profile Purpose A drop-down that lists the different profile purposes. Users can select a specific profile purpose if required, Entities only for the selected profile purposes are considered by the config director. Profile Purpose Functional Group A drop-down that lists the different profile purpose groups. Users can select a specific profile purpose group if required, Entities only for the profile purposes from the selected profile purpose group are considered by the config director. This is optional and if not selected, all profile purposes are considered by the Config Director. Lists of unique profile purposes are considered consolidated from a profile purpose and profile purpose group list. Select Components to Import Select components and optionally list entities for a component The Configuration Director will not perform any data dependency checks while specific entities are exported to take care of any logical relationship. Exclusions Profile Purposes Profile Purpose Groups Custom Profile Component Entity A custom profile text box can be used to enter wildcard based profile purposes. Note:: Exclusion takes precedence in case of conflicting inclusion and exclusion selection. Upcoming features are marked with an . Import the Selection This action allows to perform an import by selecting an already performed export or compare. Compared to New export this action of importing a section only pre-populates the InputId with the selected Export or Compare record.The components and entities are pre-populated based on the inclusion and excluded from the export/compare in export/compare list before calling the action to import the selection. User can exclude a component by deleting it from the list or exclude entity by removing entity from check list. Note: This is only required if imported data is a subset of exported data with respect to the different components Allow Delete The "Allow Delete" feature is designed to manage data deletion within the target profile during the import process, ensuring careful and deliberate user control. Here's a summary of how it works: Activation: Controlled by the property profile.based.import.allow.delete. Enabled only when this property is activated. Functionality Context: Does not affect the import of an export file. Critical during a diff import: If set to true, records in the target profile will be deleted to align with the differences specified in the diff. User Confirmation: When enabled, a confirmation popup appears during the process. Actions presented: Accept: Proceeds with the import, including deletions as per the diff results. Reject: Cancels the operation and returns to the import configuration page. Purpose: Provides a secure and explicit mechanism to handle deletions during diff imports. Ensures that any data removal is intentional and confirmed by the user. Target Profile Not Selected for Import When no target profile ID is explicitly selected during the import process, the system automatically derives the profile for import from the export or diff file. To ensure transparency and prevent unintended operations, a confirmation popup is displayed, guiding the user through the decision-making process. Key Scenarios: No Target Profile ID Selected: The profile ID for the import operation is inferred from the provided export or diff file. A confirmation popup is triggered, prompting the user to confirm or reject the use of the derived profile ID for the import. No Target Profile ID + Allow Delete Enabled: When the "Allow Delete" feature is active, the popup explicitly warns that data will be deleted in the derived target profile during the import process. This ensures users are fully informed about the implications of proceeding without explicitly selecting a profile ID. Popup Actions: Accept: Confirms the use of the profile ID derived from the export or diff file. Proceeds with the import operation, applying any deletions if "Allow Delete" is enabled. Reject: Cancels the import operation. Returns the user to the import profile configuration page to review or modify their settings. Retry The Retry functionality is designed to reattempt failed imports at various levels—entity, component, or the entire import. Triggered by a Retry icon ( ), it restarts the import process exclusively for failed items using the same process identifier. Upon retry, the result updates to either Passed, Failed, or In Progress. Successfully retried components are marked as "Retriggered" in the component tab. If the retry still fails, it can be triggered again. Key Features of Retry: Purpose: To handle failures in the import process by reattempting only the parts that failed. Minimizes rework by avoiding unnecessary re-import of successful items. Levels of Retry: Entity-Level Retry: Focuses on specific failed entities within the import. Component-Level Retry: Targets the failed component(s) of the import process. Full Import Retry: Reinitiates the entire import process for all failed components and entities. Process Flow: The retry process is triggered using the Retry icon ( ) Only the selected failed entities or components are processed again. The retry operation uses the same process identifier to maintain consistency. Outcome: Passed: Import is successfully completed for the retried items. Compare Functionality in Configuration Director (CD) 2.0 The Compare functionality in Configuration Director (CD) 2.0 enables users to perform a detailed comparison between two existing Export IDs and/or Upload IDs. It facilitates identifying differences at the record level across entities and empowers users to take specific actions based on these differences. Overview of Compare Functionality Purpose: To compare configuration data between two distinct Export IDs or Upload IDs. Granularity: Record-level comparison across all entities involved. UI Support: Currently supports Export IDs. Upload IDs will be supported in future releases and are not yet visible on the UI. Flexibility: Users can selectively import differences from the comparison results into the target profile. Optional Deletion: Allows users to delete excess records in the target profile that are not present in the source. Comparison Scenarios Export ID vs Export ID: Compare two exported datasets from different environments or profiles. Export ID vs Upload ID: Users can provide Export ID and Upload Id. Currently, uploaded Ids are not visible on the UI on the list screen. Upload ID vs Upload ID: Users can provide two Upload Id. Currently, uploaded Ids are not visible on the UI on the list screen. Key Features Visual Record-Level Difference Inspection Users can visually inspect the differences at the record level across all entities. Differences are highlighted, showing: To Add Records: Records present in the source but not in the target. To Update Records: Records present in both source and target but with differing values. To Remove Records: Records present in the target but not in the source. Selective Import from Comparison Results Users can selectively import specific record-level differences into the target profile. Provides fine-grained control to ensure only necessary changes are applied. Optional Record Deletion in Target Users can choose to delete excess data from the target profile based on comparison results. Ensures synchronization by removing records in the target that do not exist in the source. Workflow Summary Select Source and Target IDs: Choose two Export IDs (or Upload IDs) for comparison. Initiate Comparison: Trigger the comparison process. View Comparison Results: Analyze differences categorized as Added, Modified, and Removed. Selective Import: Choose specific records to import from the comparison results. Optional Deletion: Enable the deletion option to remove excess records from the target profile. Validate Changes: Review and confirm changes before finalizing the import or deletion process. Comparison Result Drill-Down Provides a detailed breakdown of differences for each entity involved in the comparison. Allows users to view: Entity-wise differences. Record-level granular changes. Side-by-side comparison of source and target data values. Use Cases Environment Synchronization: Ensure consistency between staging and production environments. Change Management: Validate changes before deployment by comparing datasets. Audit and Validation: Track and verify differences between configurations across time periods. Selective Updates: Import only specific records to minimize disruption in target environments. Key Takeaways Visual Comparison: Record-level insights for precise identification of differences. Granular Import: Selectively import required records from comparison results. Optional Deletion: Remove excess or obsolete records in the target profile. Future-Proof Design: Support for Upload IDs is planned for future releases. Auditability: Every comparison process is traceable and ensures integrity across profiles. The Compare functionality in Configuration Director 2.0 offers a powerful and flexible tool for managing configuration data differences, ensuring precise updates, and maintaining synchronization across profiles and environments.

This feature is particularly useful for transferring data across stacks and importing it into accessible profiles. Upon successful upload, the name of the uploaded zip file can be used as the Import ID to initiate the import process. Clicking the Upload button on the home page opens a small window where users can select and upload a zip file. Within this window, users can either confirm the upload by clicking Upload or cancel the operation by clicking Cancel. Once the upload process is triggered, the system monitors the status. If the status indicates success, the zip file is successfully uploaded and becomes available for import operations. All the exported data and diff files can be downloaded by clicking the button. Upon completion of the download, the button's state will update to indicate the zip file has been successfully downloaded.The downloaded zip file can then be used for cross-stack operations, enabling the transfer of data across different profiles and environments. This functionality facilitates seamless data sharing and import processes across stacks.
