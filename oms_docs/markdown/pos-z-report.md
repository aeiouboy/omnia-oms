With backoffice&gt;storeReportConfig settings as described, the Z report is automatically triggered by the Backoffice Store Close operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to Store Close the report is not available for a given business day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following Store Close the report for that day is constructed from fields as defined in the commonutil&gt;reportConfig entity, along with the configured .pdf template.&nbsp; &nbsp;An example of the base report is shown below. Once the report is created, a user with appropriate grant&nbsp;can navigate to REPORTS menu in the Backoffice and request the report for that day.&nbsp;from those available.&nbsp;Currently the Z report is only available on behalf of the entire store, when the entire store is closed. &nbsp; Z Report Example &nbsp; 20230718.1908.ZReport.pdf &nbsp; Z Report Field Definitions See Report Metric Definitions and Configurability Guide.
