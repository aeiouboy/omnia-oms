This means, when the customer comes to pick up their order or the carrier picks up a shipment, the order, line, or unit is marked as fulfilled and the Current Backlog for the location is reduced by the fulfilled amount. Retailers may optionally configure capacity to be released at the time of picking or packing instead of fulfillment so the location may accept additional orders during the time they are waiting for the customer/carrier to pick up the order. Refer How to Release capacity for more details.&nbsp; These configuration parameters allow the user to configure Picked, Packed, or Fulfilled status as the status in which to release capacity from the current backlog. Both the parameters only impact the Current Backlog value. Current Capacity Utilized is not impacted as it is never decremented within a shift (it is only reset as part of beginning a new shift).&nbsp; Note: Orders which are already beyond picked or packed status when this configuration is enabled will continue to release capacity at the time of shipment Examples&nbsp; Let&#39;s look at an example to illustrate the behavior of these parameters. Setup: &quot;Release store capacity when the customer pickup order is in: &quot;Packed&quot; &quot;Release location capacity when the ship to address order is in: &quot;Fulfilled&quot; Store&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Utilization Level Current Backlog Max Backlog &nbsp;Current capacity utilized Max Capacity A&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 B&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 C&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 Import Two Orders: Order 1: Pickup in Store A - Item A - 5 units Order 2: Ship to Address (allocated to Store B) - Item B - 3 units Store&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Utilization Level Current Backlog Max Backlog &nbsp;Current capacity utilized Max Capacity A&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 100 B&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 C&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 Both orders are Picked and Packed. The current backlog at Store A reduces to 0 and Store B remains the same because it has not been shipped yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Store&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Utilization Level Current Backlog Max Backlog &nbsp;Current capacity utilized Max Capacity A&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 100 B&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 C&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Order&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp;Order 2 is shipped and the current backlog at Store B reduces to 0.

Custom statuses may be added to this list but only if they are greater than &quot;In-Progress&quot; status (3600 and above) and less than &quot;Fulfilled&quot; status. Fulfilled status is viewed as the final status for capacity release, even if the configuration is set to release capacity during picking or packing. If a picked or packed message is missed due to a technical error and OM is expecting these messages to release capacity, the current backlog will be reconciled at the time of shipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add Additional StatusesAPI: url/order/api/ServiceDefinition/statusDefinition/save -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sample Payload: { &quot;ProcessTypeId&quot;: &quot;ORDER_EXECUTION&quot;, &quot;Status&quot;: &quot;3700.100&quot;, &quot;Description&quot;: &quot;loadAssignedEvent&quot;, &quot;PartialStatusDescription&quot;: &quot;loadAssignedEvent&quot; } Configuration Releasing&nbsp;Capacity By default, the capacity is released at the start of the next shift. However, it is possible to release capacity before that.&nbsp; This section gives details on how to release capacity usage for pick up in store and ship to address orders. Two order parameters are available to control when capacity reservations are released, allowing stores and locations to reduce the current capacity backlog.&nbsp; &quot;Release store capacity when the customer pickup order is in:&quot; - This parameter controls the status at which capacity reservations are released for orders which are to be picked up in a store. Picked, Packed, and Fulfilled statuses are available for selection from base data and extended statuses are supported as long as they are greater than &quot;In-Progress&quot; status and less than &quot;Fulfilled&quot; status. By default, if no status is selected, the system behaves as if Fulfilled status is selected. This controls customer pickups &quot;Release location capacity when the ship to address order is in:&quot; - This parameter controls the status at which capacity reservations are released for orders which are to be shipped from a location. Picked, Packed, and Fulfilled statuses are available for selection from base data and extended statuses are supported as long as they are greater than &quot;In-Progress&quot; status and less than &quot;Fulfilled&quot; status. By default, if no status is selected, the system behaves as if Fulfilled status is selected. This controls any shipments from locations or stores. An inventory parameter also needs to be set to true:&nbsp;ReduceUtilizedCapacity See the How to reduce utilized capacity page for more details.&nbsp; Implementation Flavors NA Related Articles OverviewManaging High Utilization LocationsHow Capacity WorksRest APIs & User ExitsRolling Capacity to the Next Day/ShiftCapacity as a Constraint & Optimization
