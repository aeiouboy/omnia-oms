If a user is given wildcard grants, they may automatically get access to new features which are protected by new grants that fall within the wildcard criteria. For example, users with "ui-operations::*" will get access to all the resources that starts with "ui-operations".  It is recommended to add individual grants to a role instead of wildcard grants.
