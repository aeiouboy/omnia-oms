Using Manhattan Active&reg; Store Inventory, the corporate office can send cycle count requests to the store for selected items. A store user with appropriate permission can review and approve or decline the cycle count request. The user can turn on the review based on configuration. The Store Inventory Management (SIM) - Cycle Counting Reports of Operational SCI include the details of such cycle count requests that stores make and help track their progress.&nbsp;You can access the SIM - Cycle Counting Reports&nbsp;in IBM Cognos by navigating to&nbsp;Team Content &gt; SCI Packaged Content &gt; Reports &gt; OMNI &gt; SIM - Cycle Counting. The following sections explain each report in detail.
