Example: Register&nbsp;1 creates an Order, numbered 1234 with Item ABC, and Register 2 also creates an Order 1234 with Item XYZ.&nbsp; &nbsp;With two different orders sharing the same order number, if a customer walks in with receipt number 1234 and wants to return item XYZ, at say, Terminal 3 there will be an issue:&nbsp; The receipt number is a valid transaction, but 50% of the time the items listed are incorrect.&nbsp; The reason behind this is the receipt that is displayed in POS is the first one that the application retrieves. This can also occur if there are multiple stores and a customer wants to return an item to another store.&nbsp; In this scenario, the same issue can arise due to duplicate order numbers.&nbsp; The wrong order is displayed, unable to pull up the correct one to initiate the return. &nbsp; &nbsp; To ensure unique transaction number for each order&nbsp;in Active Omni, we have the following process.&nbsp; This ensures that all transactions originating from Point of Sale are unique and next up number is generated only when the concerned transaction is updated in the relevant component.&nbsp; Process flow&nbsp; Transaction Number Attributes The standard transaction number generated in the Point of Sale system has 21 digits, with the following details and format-TTMMDDYYSSSSRRRNNNNMC, which is in: 1. TT: It is the number that signifies the transaction type.&nbsp; Active Omni has a centralized transaction number generation logic that caters to all types of transactions originating from the store.&nbsp; The various types of transactions handled are: 1: Sale/Return/Exchange order 2: Manager function transactions like Pay In, Pay Out, Till Pick Up, Till Loan, No Sale 3: Post Void Sale or Return Order 4: Post Void manager function transaction 5: Gift Card related transactions like Reload, Activation, Balance Enquiry 6: Selling more items within a Pick Up at store order 7: Exchange Tender transaction 8: Price Check Transaction 2.&nbsp;MMDDYY is the date when the transaction is captured. Note: It is essential that the Store&nbsp;display ID is of 4 digits only.&nbsp; User must ensure that the length and the type is taken care, otherwise, the transaction number may not be generated as expected. 3.&nbsp;SSSS is the Store Number from where the transaction originated.&nbsp; For transaction number generation, one must define the store location with 4 digits as the display ID. 4.&nbsp; RRR is the Register Number where the transaction occurred.&nbsp;User must set up the Register with 3 digits only. 5. NNNN is the next step generated based on the sequence defined.&nbsp; Each register in a store can have up to 9999 unique transactions created in a day.&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. M is the deployment mode in which the transaction is created.&nbsp; 0 means online, 1- edge mode. 7. C is the Check digit number for the bar code. &nbsp; Transaction number generation configurations Configurations pertaining to transaction number generation are common for an organization.&nbsp; The following configurations are provided outside of the base, and one must ensure that it meets the business requirement before starting the Point of Sale operations.&nbsp; It is recommended that this is not changed during business to avoid discrepancy in the number sequence. &nbsp; Transaction Number Configuration Purpose seriesStart This is the first number in the series for the transactions originating from the Point of Sale application.&nbsp; This is applicable to all stores and registers in the organization.&nbsp;This can be reset to start from the same number every day, based on the configuration under the &#39;rollover&#39; attribute. The base provided value for the seriesStart is 0001. seriesEnd The maximum value of the transaction number for a given store and register.&nbsp; Out of the base, this value stands at 9999.&nbsp; Once the transaction series reaches this number, it will get reset to seriesStart. rollover Indicates if the transaction number should start from the beginning of each day or continue from the last transaction of the previous day. If false, it starts from the beginning, and if true, the next day&#39;s transaction number continues from the previous day. &nbsp; Services The following APIs are the key APIs related to Transaction Number generation.&nbsp;Refer to the API documentation for additional details on&nbsp;each service.
