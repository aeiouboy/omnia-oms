The primary goal of this feature is to improve the accuracy of lead time estimates, which directly contributes to better inventory optimization and more effective order planning. Accurate lead times are crucial for efficient supply chain management. By leveraging historical receipt date, Lead Time Forecasting provides a dynamic and data-driven approach to: Improve Planning Accuracy: Ensure that replenishment recommendations and order projections are based on realistic lead times, reducing stockouts or overstocking. Optimize Inventory Levels: Maintain optimal inventory by accounting for actual delivery performance. Enhance Decision-Making: Provide reliable data for strategic purchasing and operational adjustments. &nbsp; Process Flow Lead Time Forecasting is governed by the 'Enable Lead Time Forecast' configuration, which can be defined at multiple levels: Global Parameters, Location Inheritance, and Sourcing Relationships. This layered configuration provides flexibility and control, allowing the feature to be enabled or disabled as needed at each level.&nbsp; For relationships where Lead Time Forecasting is enabled, orders will be created with the flag 'Consider for LTF = True'. When these orders are received at the destination, corresponding PO&nbsp;Receipts are generated. A scheduled job then initiates the Lead Time Forecast (LTF) calculation. During this process, the engine uses PO Receipts—specifically those for orders received after the last job run, to compute the updated lead time forecast. The calculated lead time for a given Item, Location, and Source Location is stored in a new entity and utilized during the SOQ (Suggested Order Quantity) computation, provided the sourcing relationship is enabled for Lead Time Forecasting. If no Lead Time Forecast records exist, or if the calculated lead time value is null, the system will use the lead time configured at the Item-Location-Source level or from other levels in the hierarchy. Additionally, a new user interface will be available to view and manually edit the calculated Lead Time Forecast values. The Suggested Order UI is enhanced with a new attribute: ConsiderForLeadTimeForecast, available under the 'Order Factor' widget in Suggested Order Details. The default value of this attribute will be determined by the EnableLeadTimeForecast setting defined either at the Sourcing Relationship or via the Location Inheritance policy. Users will have the ability to override this value manually. If ConsiderForLeadTimeForecast is set to 'false' for any Suggested Order, the resulting order will be created with ConsiderForLeadTimeForecast = false and will be excluded from Lead Time Forecast calculations. Configuration&nbsp; Lead Time Forecasting can be configured at multiple levels to control its behavior and application. General System Configuration (IO Parameter) Parameter Name Description EnableLeadTimeForecast Enables or disables the Lead Time Forecast feature globally.&nbsp; &nbsp; Replenishment Engine Parameters These parameters control the core calculations within the replenishment engine. Parameter Name Description CalculateDayOfWeekLeadTimeForecast Enables calculation of specific lead times for each day of the week. MaximumRelationshipMultiple Configuration value related to supplier fill rate for simulation. MinimumRelationshipMultiple Configuration value related to supplier fill rate for simulation. &nbsp; Location Inheritance Policy These settings apply to how lead times are derived for Item Locations based on higher-level configurations. Attribute&nbsp;Name Description Enable Lead Time Forecast Indicates whether Lead Time Forecasting is active for Item Locations inheriting this policy. Higher threshold for deviation Defines the upper limit for acceptable lead time deviation. Exceeding this flags an exception. Lower threshold for deviation Defines the lower limit for acceptable lead time deviation. &nbsp; Sourcing Relationship Configuration at the Sourcing Relationship level allows for fine-grained control over specific vendors or source/destination pairs. Attribute&nbsp;Name Description Enable Lead Time Forecast Indicates whether Lead Time Forecasting applies to this specific Sourcing Relationship. &nbsp; Suggested Order&nbsp; These parameters allow users to control whether specific orders contribute to the Lead Time Forecast calculation. Attribute&nbsp;Name Description Consider for Lead Time Forecast Determines if a Suggested Order should contribute to the Lead Time Forecast calculation. &nbsp; Order Consider for Lead Time Forecast Determines if an actual Order should contribute to the Lead Time Forecast calculation. &nbsp; Order Generation Policy To enable the generation of order receipts necessary for calculating Lead Time Forecast, the Order Generation Policy must be configured with Track Order = true. &nbsp; Scheduled Job Setup The Lead Time Forecast computation is initiated by a scheduled job. Users need to set up and manage the schedule for this job within the system's job scheduler. The job will publish messages for processing, processing receipts and computing the forecast. {{url}}/ai-replenishment/api/batch/jobSchedule/triggerAdhoc { "JobTypeId": "LeadTimeForecastJobType", "JobTypeDefinition":"Job Type to trigger lead time forecast" } The user receives an alert notification when the Lead Time Forecast process is initiated and another notification upon its completion. UIs and Entities The Lead Time Forecast feature introduces new UI elements and utilizes specific entities to store and manage the calculated lead times and related data. User Interfaces (UIs): UI Name Component Group Seed Data Present &nbsp;Seed Data Profile Lead Time Forecast Results Inventory Optimization No N/A &nbsp;Entities&nbsp; &nbsp;Description Order Receipts &nbsp; To capture detailed information about Purchase Order receipts at the line level. This entity serves as the primary input data source for the Lead Time Forecast calculation. Lead Time Forecast (LTF History) To store the system-calculated Lead Time Forecast results. This entity persists the output of the Lead Time Forecasting engine and is referenced by other planning modules (e.g., SOQ) when calculating replenishment needs. It also serves as the data source for the "Lead Time Forecast Results" UI. Services N/A &nbsp; Troubleshooting This section provides guidance on common issues users might encounter and how to troubleshoot them. Problem 1: Lead Times in Planning (e.g., SOQ) are Not Updating or Seem Incorrect. Possible Cause: The Lead Time Forecast feature might not be fully enabled or configured correctly across all necessary levels. Troubleshooting Steps: Check Global Enablement: Verify the&nbsp;EnableLeadTimeForecast&nbsp;parameter in the IO Parameter configuration. Ensure it is set to&nbsp;True. Check Hierarchy Configuration: Review&nbsp;EnableLeadTimeForecast&nbsp;settings at the Location Inheritance Policy and Sourcing Relationship levels. Higher-level configurations may override lower-level ones if not explicitly defined. Verify Scheduler Job: Confirm that the Lead Time Forecast Computation scheduled job is running successfully and regularly. Check its last run time and any error logs. The job is responsible for triggering the calculation process. Review&nbsp;OrderReceipts&nbsp;Data: Ensure that relevant purchase order receipts are captured correctly in the&nbsp;OrderReceipts&nbsp;entity. Inspect&nbsp;LeadTimeForecast&nbsp;Entity: Go to the "Lead Time Forecast Results" UI and check the calculated lead times for the specific Item/Location/Source. Are they present? Do they reflect recent receipt data? Problem 2: Specific Orders Are Not Influencing Lead Time Calculations. Possible Cause: The&nbsp;ConsiderForLeadTimeForecast&nbsp;flag might be incorrectly set for those orders. Troubleshooting Steps: Check Suggested Order/Order Configuration: On the "Suggested Order Details" or "Order Details" screen, verify the&nbsp;Enable Lead Time Forecast&nbsp;toggle (or corresponding&nbsp;ConsiderForLeadTimeForecast&nbsp;attribute). Ensure it is set to&nbsp;True&nbsp;for orders that should contribute to the calculation.
