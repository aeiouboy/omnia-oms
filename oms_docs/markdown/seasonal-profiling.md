If configured in the policy, the system allows for 1 year + a partial year history, but it needs to borrow data from the complete year to extend the data to a full year, e.g., 52 weeks + 48 weeks partial year; the remaining 4 weeks will use last year&rsquo;s 4 weeks. &nbsp; Seasonal Profile&nbsp;is generated&nbsp;according to the thresholds and parameters that are configured in the seasonal profile policy.&nbsp; When the seasonal quotient or seasonal degree thresholds are too high, or the minimum amount of historical sales data is not met, there is no seasonality that can be derived from history, and the system will throw an exception and will not&nbsp;generate any seasonal profile.&nbsp; Although it is possible to have&nbsp;multiple reasons for seasonal profiles not being generated, the&nbsp;system will only log and show the&nbsp;first encountered exception&nbsp;in the Seasonal Profile Exceptions UI.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A user may associate and rank a set of seasonal profile policies&nbsp;with a forecast policy.&nbsp; During forecast initiation, for each item location, the system reviews those&nbsp;seasonal profile policies that are associated with the forecast policy, starting from the highest rank.&nbsp; The first seasonal profile with matching item location will be used for calculating forecast projections. &nbsp; During the period roll, the previous period of demand is de-seasonalized using the corresponding seasonal profile index value, and the forecast update calculates the new forecast projection by applying the most recent highest rank seasonal profile to the de-seasonalized demand.&nbsp; &nbsp; Configuration Seasonal Profile Policy Define one or more Seasonal Profile Policies&nbsp;for recognizing the seasonal pattern in demand and&nbsp;for inserting seasonality into the forecast.
