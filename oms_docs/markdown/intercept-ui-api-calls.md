Below are the steps to get details on the command router entry and how to proceed further for customizing the API call from UI. Go to https://&lt;host&gt;/omnifacade/#/devtools page &rarr; Troubleshoot System Click on the Command Router feature of the customerengagementfacade for example. Enter the URL from the browser developer tool in inputUrl textbox to get all the details of the command router for that particular API. IMPORTANT INFO Whenever you intercept the command router entries, you need to ensure you forward the call back to the same URL which UI was trying to hit and also ensure all the request parameters are forwarded to base. For example, if you intercept the call customerengagement/api/ds/order/save with parameter ShippingAddressChanged=true,&nbsp;then after you manipulate the request or before you manipulate the response, ensure you forward the call to this same api using the rest template and also forward the parameter ShippingAddressChanged=true Note: &nbsp; There might be some router API&rsquo;s as below manh.command-router.commands.getOrderByOrderAndOrderLineId.commandPath=/customerservice/order/order/orderId/*/orderLine/orderLineId/* manh.command-router.commands.getOrderByOrderAndOrderLineId.targetComponent=com-manh-cp-order manh.command-router.commands.getOrderByOrderAndOrderLineId.targetEndpoint=/api/order/order/orderId Whereas the targetEndpoint may not have all the parameters that are being sent in commandPath. You can still intercept those calls and have targetComponent and targetEndpoint something like: manh.command-router.commands.getOrderByOrderAndOrderLineId.targetComponent: com-manh-cp-ext-order manh.command-router.commands.getOrderByOrderAndOrderLineId.targetEndpoint: /customerservice/order/order/orderId/*/orderLine/orderLineId/* &nbsp; Related Articles OverviewPatternsiFramesBase Components Best PracticesExtension Util FunctionsButtonsField ExtensionsLeft Navigation Menu
