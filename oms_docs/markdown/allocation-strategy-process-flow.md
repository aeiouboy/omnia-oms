The priority for locations (grade or minimum need-based) is also specified at this stage. Policy configuration - business rules for picking items and stores for allocation are specified. Phase configuration - business rules that will govern the allocation parameters like pack rounding, constraints, inventory holdback %, etc can be specified in this stage. Users can specify different parameters for each phase of the item lifecycle, including pre-season, in-season, and end-of-season. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
