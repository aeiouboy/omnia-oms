The MAO Promotion application allows users to configure order and orderLine extended and base attributes as promotional qualifier inclusions.&nbsp; However, all possible attributes are not shown by default in the base promo config UI.&nbsp; Below are steps to configure and expose these attributes.&nbsp; The basic strategy is to configure the attributes as labels&nbsp;which can be passed to the promotion UI.&nbsp; These labels will then be used for promotion qualification. To illustrate, consider the hypothetical use case: If a customer is purchasing an item and warranty as part of an order and if they also purchase a cleaning kit as part of the order, then the cleaning kit is discounted.&nbsp; Users can define&nbsp;an extended attribute at the order header level to track whether the customer is purchasing a warranty or not, and it will be used as part of qualifying criteria to apply promotion to the &quot;cleaning kit&quot; SKU. Note:&nbsp;This functionality is only available for Qualifier Inclusions - additional base or extended Order or OrderLine attributes as Exclusions are not supported. Order Attributes Use Cases Configure one base and one extended attribute to be qualifying inclusions for promotion evaluation Show&nbsp;Order attributes on Promo Config UI In this example, we are going to configure the fields below, order&gt;currencyCode (base) and order&gt;extended&gt;Warranty (extended), for promotion evaluation. 1.&nbsp; Attributes to be used from Order entity : CurrencyCode - This is a base field Warranty - This is an extended field at the order level &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark the fields in order entity as labels Use the API below to mark the fields as labels. Be sure to&nbsp;append the data for FieldNames if there are any existing values. Make sure that they are at the correct org level. POST URL - {{url}}/order/api/fwcore/attributeLabelsConfig/save Body { &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;EntitysName&quot;: &quot;Order&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;FieldNames&quot;: &quot;CurrencyCode,Extended.Warranty&quot; } &nbsp; Note: Only String and Integer type of order fields are supported for promotion evaluation.&nbsp; Field names used in this step must exist in the Order entity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: All the labels are case-sensitive. For example, if you&nbsp;configured CurrencyCode as USD in promotion inclusion and your order has CurrencyCode Usd, that order won&#39;t qualify for the promotion. Note: This should be executed at the organization level where the promotion is applicable. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion UI - Configure Labels to be shown in the UI All the default order attributes shown in Promotion exclusion/inclusion screen are coming from the Available Attribute entity via the seed data.&nbsp; We can extend this list by adding new order attributes using below mentioned API&#39;s.&nbsp; Note: Login with system admin to add the entry. Create the entries for Currency Code & Extended Warranty POST URL - {{url}}/pricepromo/api/rules/availableAttribute/bulkImport Body &nbsp; { &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Data&quot;: [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;SourceValue&quot;: null, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AttributeLabel&quot;: &quot;Extended Warranty&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AvailableEntityId&quot;: &quot;order&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AttributeDataType&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AttributeDataTypeId&quot;: &quot;text&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ListDataType&quot;: null, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;SourceType&quot;: null, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ListFunctions&quot;: null, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AvailableAttributeId&quot;: &quot;Extended.Warranty&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;SourceValue&quot;: null, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AttributeLabel&quot;: &quot;Currency Code&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AvailableEntityId&quot;: &quot;order&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AttributeDataType&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AttributeDataTypeId&quot;: &quot;text&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ListDataType&quot;: null, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;SourceType&quot;: null, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ListFunctions&quot;: null, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;AvailableAttributeId&quot;: &quot;CurrencyCode&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } &nbsp; &nbsp; ] } &nbsp; Note: The value of AvailableAttributeId filed in this request should match with FieldNames used in labels configuration in previous steps. In this sample it&#39;s CurrencyCode & Extended.Warranty 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you add the above entries, you will get the option under Order available type &nbsp; &nbsp; Use Order Inclusions for Deal Evaluation Inherently base attributes are populated during order creation. However,&nbsp; ensure that the value for any extended attribute is written to the order data during order creation; otherwise,&nbsp;it can&#39;t be included in promotional evaluation by the promo engine. Order mod type - configure mod types as appropriate to invoke promotion evaluation of the cart price basket when&nbsp;required.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if the extended.Warranty is added as part of activating a customer (hypothetically), configure mPOS to evaluate promotion when customer ID is updated. &nbsp; OrderLine Attributes Use Cases Configure one base and one extended attribute to be qualifying inclusions for promotion evaluation. Show&nbsp;OrderLine attributes on Promo Config UI In this sample, we are going to configure the fields below, order&gt;orderLine&gt;sellingLocationId and order&gt;orderLIne&gt;extended.LineWarranty&nbsp;(extended), for promotion evaluation. 1.
