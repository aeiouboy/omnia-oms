Home &rsaquo;&rsaquo;Manhattan Active® Supply Chain Planning&rsaquo;&rsaquo;UI Help&rsaquo;&rsaquo;Allocation ››Order Release Process Order Release Process &nbsp; Order Release ProcessOverview Overview When a supply for a particular item&nbsp;is allocated and is moved to Suggested status, allocation result details are created with quantity to be allocated to each destination location.&nbsp; &nbsp; Order Policy defines the criteria and distinct attributes (e.g., Origin-Destination&nbsp;pair) for aggregating ARD records, converting them into order lines, and grouping them&nbsp;into different&nbsp;orders.&nbsp; Each organization can have one policy&nbsp;at any given time.&nbsp; When the supply is approved, order and order lines are generated in Open status based on the information from the supply and its corresponding allocation results.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The maximum order lines in the order policy criteria sets the maximum number of&nbsp;order lines in an order.&nbsp; If the number of lines is exceeded, then the system&nbsp;will generate a new order and attach the remaining order lines to this new order.&nbsp; Order Release Policy also has some criteria for auto-releasing&nbsp;orders into an API (Approved Order JSON).&nbsp; &nbsp; There are two jobs that run in frequency and can be scheduled to auto-release an order, or called from the Orders UI to manually release an order: &nbsp; Eligible Order Release Scheduled Job checks for the order policy criteria before releasing an order: The source type in the order lines of the order matches with the Auto release order defined in the&nbsp; Order release policy. The supply expected delivery date of the order line - horizon days in order policy &lt;=&nbsp;Current business date. The minimum quantity of the order is greater than or equal (&nbsp;&gt;=) to the minimum quantity defined in the order policy. All Order Release Scheduled Job releases all unreleased orders without checking any of the policy criteria.&nbsp; This job can be run less frequently than the other job, when all open orders must be released (e.g., at the end of the day, or at the end of the week).&nbsp; When an order is manually released from the UI, this job is called to release the selected orders. When an order is released, the order is converted&nbsp;into an API (Approved Order JSON) and the order is moved to Release status. This order is then published in a queue (e.g., ai-all-xin-orderToMAO queue), ready to be translated and consumed by another system. &nbsp;
