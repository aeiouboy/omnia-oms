Order projections give buyers a more accurate prediction of what demand will be for the future, to help them take informed decisions. Order Projections display the projected orders for each SKU. &nbsp; PO Projections When suppliers request insights into your expected orders over a specific timeframe, they seek a projected order schedule. These projections help them plan ahead, ensuring they have the necessary resources, materials, and capacity to fulfill their requirements efficiently. By providing this information in advance, we enable suppliers to anticipate demand, optimize production processes, and allocate resources effectively, reducing the risk of stockouts, delays, or overproduction. This is accomplished through the generation of purchase order (PO) projections. We are enhancing PO projections by incorporating factors such as bracketing. Users can access PO projections for configured days and generate them on demand, in addition to the scheduled job, for greater flexibility and accuracy. Note: 1)&nbsp; The 'Calculate PO Projection' configuration needs to be set to 'true' in IMS for the PO projection job to pick it up, and this attribute will be set as true when order build runs with PO projection configurations are enabled at sourcing relationship level. 2)&nbsp;The&nbsp;'enablePOProjForVendorRelationships' needs to be set to 'true'. Then, PO Projection calculates only for relationships where source type =Vendor, else it will calculate for all the sourcing relationships. Process Flow&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PO Projections will be triggered by a batch job. Projections will be calculated&nbsp;for the first 35 Days then Weekly for 52 weeks Aggregation by Relationship (By Item)&nbsp;will be displayed in PO Projection UI Aggregation at Relationship Level (across Item) will be displayed in Order Summary - Order Projection Aggregation at Location Level (across Relationship) will be displayed in the Unified Business Planning Console Example - Order Projections vs PO ProjectionsBelow are the examples for Order Projections and PO Projections:- &nbsp; Order Projections These are the projections for each SKU.
