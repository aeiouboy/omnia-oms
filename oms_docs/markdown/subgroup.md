Buyers can track one product line differently from other product lines from the same vendor, by creating a Sub-Group. Subgroups allow buyers to create separate purchase orders for specific Item Locations purchased from the same supplier. Why do we need Sub group? There might be one supplier that sells several different types of products. If a business manages the products by product line and not by supplier, buyers might want to create separate relationships for the supplier based on product line. (for example, frozen vs. non-frozen Items) A supplier might have different bracket requirements or lead times for Items within the relationship. Buyers will have to specify different relationship parameters for the Items so that separate orders can be created. Users might want to segregate the Item by temperature, zone etc. Items&nbsp;that are purchased from a single supplier must be on separate POs for shipping purposes. &nbsp; Source Destination Sub-Group Item SOQ DC1 Store 1 Frozen Green Peas 140 DC1 Store 1 Dairy Milk 110 DC1 Store 1 High LT Shirt 650 DC1 Store 1 &nbsp; Pens 220 &nbsp; &nbsp; Process Flow: &nbsp; Sub Groups Setup: Sub Groups will be defined at the Sourcing Relationship and the Item Location Source.
