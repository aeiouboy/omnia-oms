Replenishment Hub and Spoke When a location like a DC or Hub Store has its own demand for an item, in addition to the demand from supported stores or spokes, the Item-Location Order is calculated in two parts. The demand from destination locations is treated as a lower echelon, and their order projections are rolled up to the source location.&nbsp;The demand from the source location is consolidated with the order projections from other locations to calculate the SOQ for the DC or Hub. Manhattan Active&reg; SCP captures demand to generate the forecast, which is then consolidated with projections from other locations. These consolidated projections are used to calculate the SOQ and order projections for the DC or Hub. The SOQ computation includes planned demand for the DC&rsquo;s direct demand, ensuring it applies solely to the DC. Similarly, the planned demand for a Hub Store is considered as part of the Hub Store&#39;s own demand, without impacting the demand for Spoke Stores. This applies to both unit-based and percentage-based planned demand configurations. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Hub and Spoke &nbsp; Supporting Primary Source for Change Supplier In this release, Manhattan Active SCP introduces a new &lsquo;Primary Source&rsquo; attribute to the item location entity. This ID-type attribute allows the user to designate a primary supplier for each item at a specific location, even when multiple supplier records exist. The system would perform the SOQ calculation only for the primary supplier and ensure that the item-location is removed from the suggested order for the old primary source and added to the suggested order for the new one. Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Order Build Order Refresh Process In this release, Manhattan Active&reg; SCP introduces an Order Refresh Process to ensure up-to-date SOQ computations for orders due today, reflecting inventory and forecast changes in response to configuration updates. These updates may include changes to policies, items, locations, mappings, relationships, order groups, subgroups, and lifecycle states (e.g., from active to discontinued). Although these updates do not trigger real-time SOQ recalculations, they will be incorporated during the next SOQ or order build computation when a real-time trigger occurs. The new process will re-evaluate relevant relationships and item-location mappings each night as the calendar date changes, ensuring that outdated SOQs are corrected. Additionally, orders in the &quot;Review in Progress&quot; state will be reset and included in this process to maintain accurate order calculations. Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Order Auto Release Manhattan Active&reg; SCP now supports automatic release of Suggested Orders based on user-defined thresholds. The auto-release process can consider order exceptions with configurable options to control release behavior. Users can configure orders to be released regardless of any exceptions, or prevent release if exceptions are present or order level thresholds are not met. Additionally, auto-release can be disabled for a relationship or order group. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is controlled by grants and a configuration that is disabled by default. Related: &nbsp;Automatically Release Orders &nbsp; Subgroups Manhattan Active&reg; SCP Sub-Groups allow users to define multiple relationships for the same source and destination. This feature enables buyers to manage different product lines separately, even if they come from the same vendor, by creating distinct Sub-Groups. With Sub-Groups, buyers can generate separate purchase orders for specific item location source/relationship purchased from the same supplier, offering greater flexibility in tracking and managing inventory. Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Subgroups &nbsp; Order Generation Track Order Status The supply chain planning (SCP) offers crucial insights into the status of purchase and distribution orders, allowing buyers to effectively manage their supply chain operations. Buyers can track whether purchase orders (POs) to vendors are still open, nearing their due dates, partially or fully received, or canceled. Key statuses include &lsquo;Past Due (Not Received)&rsquo; for orders that are overdue, &lsquo;Open (Not Received)&rsquo; for orders with upcoming delivery dates, &lsquo;Partially Shipped/Shipped&rsquo; for orders with some or all items shipped, and &lsquo;Partially Received&rsquo; for orders with items already received at the destination. This visibility helps buyers make informed decisions, address delays, and take corrective action with vendors or distribution centers to ensure timely deliveries and optimize inventory management. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Track Order Status &nbsp; Allocation Applying Order Cycle after Order Frequency Simulation Order frequency simulation computes the costs associated with order cycles from 1 to 365 days for a sourcing relationship or order group. The system will recommend the Order Cycle at the least cost.&nbsp; Users can view the OFS results, review various costs corresponding to each of the Order Cycle days and then decide to apply either the system&#39;s suggested order cycle or any other order cycle that suits their business requirements. Freight Cost Freight cost is the cost incurred for transporting goods from one location to another. It is determined based on the mode of transport and the weight of the goods. Freight cost is a key input for the Order Frequency Simulation process. Manhattan Active&reg; SCP now allows users to configure Freight Costs for various weight ranges for a Sourcing Relationship. The Order Frequency Simulation will now be able to calculate the optimal review cycle for the sourcing relationship, accounting for all relevant cost factors, including freight cost. Note: Freight costs are supported only for the Weight UOM. Volume/Packaging UOM is not supported. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Order Frequency Simulation &nbsp; Configurations &nbsp; Global Configuration UI In this release, Manhattan Active&reg; SCP has consolidated the parameters of different components into a single view. The new Global Config UI simplifies the user experience by displaying all parameters in one place, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple UIs for Allocation and SCP.&nbsp; Additionally, the UI now supports data types Boolean with checkbox which improves usability. &nbsp; Enablement:&nbsp;This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Global Parameters&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Demand Forecasting &nbsp; Estimated Lost Sales Lost Sales refer to missed selling opportunities that occur when an item is out of stock or due to other factors that prevent a business from making a sale. Typically, lost sales are calculated as the difference between expected or average demand and actual sales. Capturing Lost Sales is crucial for generating accurate forecasts. Lost sales can be either imported from an external system or estimated (calculated) for an Item Location. These lost sales can be estimated daily or at the end of a period (e.g., weekly) before running the Forecast Update as part of the Period Roll processes for the upcoming period. SCP already supports interfaced lost sales, which can be imported from an external system into the Demand Metrics component&rsquo;s MetricsLog entity using the &quot;InterfacedLostSales&quot; metric type. Interfaced lost sales are considered in the following forecast jobs: Demand Cleansing: Interfaced lost sales will be included in the cleansed sales calculation. Forecast Update: Interfaced lost sales from the previous period will be included in the clamped-cleansed sales calculation. Manhattan Active&reg; SCP has been enhanced to support estimated lost sales. The Lost Demand Type, Adjustment Factor, and Out of Stock Point fields will now be available on both the Item Inheritance Policy and Item Location UIs. Default values for these fields will be set on the Item Inheritance Policy UI. However, any values entered for Lost Demand Type, Adjustment Factor, and Out of Stock Point in the Item Location UI will override the corresponding values in the Item Inheritance Policy. &nbsp; Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Estimated Lost Sales &nbsp; Manual Forecast Change The Manhattan Active&reg; SCP application has been enhanced to update the Forecast UI, which is now structured in a tab format.&nbsp; Summary Tab: Users can edit the Seasonalized Forecast field, triggering a recalculation of the current forecast and forecast projections, and setting the manual forecast flag to &lsquo;True&rsquo;.&nbsp; Forecast Factors Tab: Users can modify the Standard Deviation Percentage, affecting related calculations. Other forecast factor fields remain non-editable.&nbsp; Forecast Projections Tab: Displays 52 periods of data, reflecting updates from other tabs, but does not allow direct editing. When the save button is clicked, the system ensures that any changes to the Seasonalized Forecast and Standard Deviation Percentage are processed correctly, updating the backend and preserving data integrity across fields. &nbsp;This also triggers a Standard Order Quantity (SOQ) calculation update for the replenishment system. &nbsp; Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: Demand Forecasting &nbsp; New Item Location When a new Item Location is added to Forecasting with the Auto Association flag enabled, the&nbsp;system will automatically associate it with the relevant Forecast Policies and generate the corresponding Forecast record. &nbsp;A newly introduced item location must already be part of a forecast policy in order for the system to generate the forecast. The &lsquo;Unmatched Item Location&rsquo; UI helps users identify item locations that are not yet associated with any existing forecast policies, allowing them to associate the corresponding item locations with the appropriate forecast policies and trigger the auto-association process. &nbsp; Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Related: New Item Location &nbsp; View Metrics All metrics for an item location can now be viewed and exported through a related link within the Item Location Details view. Key Features: View all metrics for the single item location. Filter metrics by metric type, grouping keys, and dates. Export metrics directly from this page. &nbsp; Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. &nbsp; Other New Documentation Process Guides Forecast Initialization Order Review and Approval Calendar Build Pattern and Exception Forecast Update Forecast Assignment Criteria Device and OS Support The SCP application is now certified for use on the OS with the latest version of Chrome as a browser. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
