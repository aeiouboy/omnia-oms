By creating order groups, you can: View aggregated order totals View order exceptions across all group members Override bracket policies for all group members &nbsp;Recalculate and approve all relationship orders Why do we need Order group? You may encounter the following ordering challenges: The supplier is offering a deal for all locations in your network, you want to apply the deal to all locations at once without having to apply the deal individually to each location. Need to build to a full truckload across four stores on a delivery route or you have four different suppliers on a backhaul route. If you have multiple relationships with a supplier due to the use of sub-groups, the supplier needs to accumulate the total value of your orders to meet a specific target. However, they still require separate purchase orders for each transaction.&quot; As a solution,&nbsp;&nbsp;use order groups to build an order total using multiple relationships. For example, the three locations for supplier ABC each have their own order totals. When added to an order group, the three individual totals equal the order group total, as illustrated in the following figure. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Order group totals in for Supplier ABC. &nbsp; &nbsp; Process Flow Considerations: A relationship can exist in only one order group at a time. You can review and approve orders at the order group level, it creates a separate PO for each relationship in the order group. When you perform order approval for the order group, it creates a purchase order for every relationship with an order total greater than zero. You can review and approve orders for each individual relationship within the group. Order groups can have their own brackets. Order groups can have their exception policy and it will apply to child relationships as well. Each order group requires the appropriate setup and configuration to begin buying. Review schedular exception configuration user can configure at order group level , system will override the sourcing relationship configuration if review schedular exception configured at order group level. User can perform below actions at order group level o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Review o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancel Review o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approve o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recalculate at order group o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build with Extra days o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build to bracket &nbsp; Configuration How to set up order group?
