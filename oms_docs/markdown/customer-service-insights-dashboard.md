The dashboard also provides quantifiable metrics to illustrate the impact Digital Self-Service(DSS) has on your contact center, if it’s enabled, or to illustrate the potential impact it could have if it’s not enabled. In addition to organization-specific metrics, the dashboard also displays industry metrics anonymously aggregated across all Manhattan Active® Omni customers. Industry metrics are displayed in blue text to the right of the organization-specific metrics in black on select visuals. The black arrow indicates how the organization compares to the industry. Note: The Customer Service Insights Dashboard is only populated for production environments. All lower environments (stage, VPT, and so on) do not have data populated because computing metrics on test data would not yield relevant results. This dashboard displays data only for the selected organization, whether it is a parent or a child organization. If the selected organization is a parent organization, the results will not automatically include the data from the respective child organizations as well. The user must switch to a child organization to view the insights of the child organization. Begin exploring the dashboard by selecting a time range at the top of the page. Users can select up to 31 consecutive days (1 month) from the past 2 years. By default, data for the past 7 days (excluding current day) is displayed. See the table below for descriptions of each metric on the Customer Insights Dashboard. Metric Description Address Change Edits Displays the total number of instances where the shipping address was updated after order confirmation within the selected date range. The percentage where a shipping address change action occurred on confirmed orders This result is for the selected date range. Note: There is a chance that this number could be more than 100% since one order can have multiple address edits Address Change Initiation Breakdown Provides a breakdown of address change actions based on the source of initiation - Customer Service (CS), Digital Self-Service (DSS), or others - helping them understand where customers prefer to make changes. This result is for the selected date range. If you enabled Digital Self-Service Address Changes Estimates the number of address change requests that could have been reduced in the contact center if Digital Self-Service was enabled. Calculation: Avg. monthly address change requests for the retailer (past 12 months) × Industry Digital Self-Service address change % This result is not tied to the selected date range; it is based on overall monthly averages for the past year. Your Impact of Enabling Digital Self-Service Address Changes Displays the approximate reduction in address change requests to the contact center due to Digital Self-Service being enabled, based on the retailer's historical Digital Self-Service adoption in the business. Retailer's total average monthly address change requests × Retailer's Digital Self-Service address change % This result is not tied to the selected date range; it is based on overall monthly averages. Return Units Total number of returned units within the selected date range. Line graph showing how return unit volume changes over time within the selected range. Return Rate Indicates the percentage of confirmed orders that were returned. Total confirmed return orders action ÷ Total confirmed orders This result is for the selected date range. Return Initiation breakdown Provides insights into the source of return initiation, categorizing returns by CS, DSS, or other sources. This result is for the selected date range. If you enabled Digital Self-Service Returns Estimates the number of return requests that could have been prevented in the contact center with Digital Self-Service adoption, using industry benchmarks. Retailers' average monthly return requests (based on the past 12 months) × Industry Digital Self-Service return % This result is not for the selected date range; it is based on overall monthly averages. The Impact of enabling Digital self-service Returns Displays the approximate reduction in return requests to the contact center due to Digital Self-Service being enabled, based on the retailer's historical Digital Self-Service adoption in the business Retailer's average monthly return requests × Retailer's avg Digital Self-Service return % for the past 12 months This result is not for the selected date range; it is based on overall monthly averages. Return-to Location Type For all the returns initiated - this metric displays the breakdown of return to location type. This result is for the selected date range. Return Reason Categorizes returns based on the reason provided by customers, helping identify common return drivers. This result is for the selected date range. Exchange Rate Displays the proportion of confirmed orders that resulted in an exchange, indicating how often customers opt for exchanges instead of returns. Total confirmed exchange order actions ÷ Total confirmed customer orders This result is for the selected date range. If you enabled Exchanges Estimates the potential revenue gain from enabling exchanges instead of direct returns, using industry exchange rate data. Retailers' average monthly return orders × Retailers' Avg order value × Industry exchange rate % This result is not for the selected date range - it is based on overall average data. Note: This section will only be available for retailers that do not support exchanges. Cancellation Rate It shows the percentage of instances cancellation actions were made on confirmed orders, helping assess order stability. Total instances of cancellation actions on confirmed orders ÷ Total confirmed orders This result is for the selected date range. Note: There is a chance that this number could be more than 100% since one order can have multiple cancellations Cancellation Initiation Breakdown Provides insights into the source of cancellation requests, categorizing them by CS, DSS, or other sources. This result is for the selected date range. If you enabled Digital self-service Cancellations Estimates the number of cancellation requests that could have been prevented in the contact center with DSS adoption, using industry benchmarks. Retailer's average monthly cancellations × Industry DSS cancellation % for the past year This result is not for the selected date range - it is based on overall average data. The Impact of enabling Digital self-service Cancellations Displays the approximate reduction in cancellation requests to the contact center due to Digital Self-Service being enabled, based on historical business adoption of self-service Retailer's average monthly cancellations × Retailer's DSS cancellation %. This result is not for the selected date range - it is based on overall average data. BOPIS Cancellation Rate It shows the percentage of instances cancellations were made on BOPIS confirmed orders. Total number of cancellation actions on BOPIS orders ÷ Total confirmed BOPIS confirmed orders This result is for the selected date range. Note: There is a chance that this number could be more than 100% since one order can have multiple cancellations Note: To calculate this metric, an order is considered as a BOPIS order if at least one line on the order is a BOPIS or Ship to Store line. If you enabled Estimates the potential revenue gain from reducing BOPIS cancellations by offering a "Ship It Instead" option. Retailer's average monthly BOPIS cancellations * Retailers Avg BOPIS orderline value * Industry's Avg ship-it-instead adoption% This result is not for the selected date range - it is based on overall average data.
