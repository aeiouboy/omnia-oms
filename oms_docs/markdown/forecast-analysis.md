The Forecast Analysis UI graph&nbsp;provides a clear and detailed visualization of sales history, forecast trends, and seasonality, allowing users to analyze and interpret forecast data effectively. The graph consists of well-defined X and Y axes, interactive legends, and stacked bars to represent various data points. The X-axis represents the time range and is set to a default zoom level of one year. Users have the flexibility to zoom in for a more detailed view or zoom out to see a broader range of data.&nbsp; On the left side of the graph, the Y-axis represents the number of units, which are displayed as stacked bars and a line chart. The minimum value for stacked bars is set to zero, ensuring that any negative values are automatically shown as zero to maintain data clarity. On the right side, the Y-axis represents the seasonal index, which is displayed as a shaded area, helping users identify seasonal patterns that impact sales and forecasts. At the bottom of the graph, a legend allows users to toggle specific data points on or off for better visualization. The legend follows a specific order, starting with raw sales, followed by lost sales, cleansed sales, promotional demand, seasonal profile, forecast, and planned demand. This structured arrangement makes it easier for users to distinguish different forecast components and analyze their impact. The graph includes multiple stacked bars and line charts to represent key forecasting elements. Sales history, which reflects raw sales data, is displayed alongside cleansed demand. The forecast, whether system-generated or manually adjusted, is shown as a key reference point, as it is&nbsp;used for inventory optimization. A shaded area represents the seasonal profile, helping users understand seasonal trends over time. Effective lost sales data, whether interfaced or estimated, is included as part of the stacked bars, along with promotional demand, which accounts for either interfaced or estimated promotional sales. Planned demand, covering both past and future periods, is also represented within the stacked bars. The total forecast is visually represented as a combination of the seasonalized forecast and planned demand. This approach ensures that all forecast components are accounted for in a comprehensive and structured manner. By integrating these elements into a single interactive graph, users can analyze trends, identify exceptions, and make data-driven decisions with ease. Note: Total Forecast (Seasonalized Forecast + Planned Demand) Supported Use Cases Sales Forecast Analysis: Identify sales trends and seasonality effects. Forecast Adjustments: Modify, freeze, or manually update forecast values. Historical Forecast Comparison: Compare past forecast data with actual sales. &nbsp; UIs and Entities NA Services NA Related Articles Forecast SummaryManual Forecast ChangeDemand Classification &amp; CleansingDay of Week ProfileForecast InitializationLost Sales for Forecasting Future Forecast AdjustmentsSeasonal ProfilingForecast UpdateForecast Assignment CriteriaDemand ForecastingExclusions RulesForecast ExceptionsAggregated Seasonal Profile New Item Location Auto-Associaton &nbsp; &nbsp;
