It helps businesses evaluate trade-offs between service goals and safety stock investments, ensuring a balance between customer satisfaction and inventory costs. By analyzing item locations through a configured strategy, SIS enables users to refine safety stock levels and improve item availability while minimizing excess inventory. The Service Investment Strategy (SIS) is essential for optimizing inventory management by balancing cost and availability. It helps reduce overall inventory costs while ensuring sufficient stock levels to improve customer service. By enabling data-driven decision-making, SIS allows businesses to make optimal safety stock investments, minimizing excess inventory while maintaining high service levels. This streamlined approach enhances efficiency and ensures a more responsive supply chain. If it is an upper-echelon location, only velocity analysis can be performed. However, for lower-echelon locations, such as stores, both safety stock analysis and velocity analysis can be conducted. Use Case Supported: Calculate the best service levels to deliver to the customer based on costs and location. Example Use Cases: A retailer wants to optimize its inventory investments by segmenting items based on velocity and setting service level goals. A distributor needs to improve fill rates while minimizing safety stock holding costs. A Service Group is a collection of Item Locations that are grouped together and share the same SIS simulation strategy for calculating the correct level of safety stock for each item location based on your service level objectives. A service group can be directly associated with individual item locations. The Service and Investment Strategy (SIS) Simulation Results are generated as an outcome of an SIS policy run. An SIS policy consists of user-defined simulation configurations for a combination of a Service Group and a Location Group (which may include multiple locations, such as Stores and Distribution Centers). The SIS Results represent the simulation outcomes for each Service Group, Location Group, and Location ID, along with the associated item-locations defined within the specific SIS policy. Note: Simulation results are only viewable once the job/process is completed. Sample Flow: Define Service Group: A set of items and locations that form the foundation for the SIS analysis. Define Location Group: A logical grouping of locations (e.g., stores, distribution centers) to apply a common SIS policy. Define SIS Policy: Configure the parameters for the velocity analysis and safety stock simulations, including: Velocity Classification Safety Stock Strategy Run SIS Simulation: Trigger the simulation process to analyze item locations and generate results. Review and Apply SIS Results: View the generated safety stock simulation results. Select a simulation for application to item locations to update the Velocity and Service Level. &nbsp; Process Flow &nbsp; &nbsp; The Service Investment Strategy (SIS) process begins by defining a Service Group,&nbsp;where items and locations are categorized based on attributes or item categories. Next, a Location Group is created to logically group locations, enabling the assignment of a SIS policy across multiple locations. Once these groups are established, the SIS Policy&nbsp;is configured by selecting a Service Group and a Location Group, followed by defining key parameters such as the&nbsp;Safety Stock strategy, Optimization Objective ID, Management Policy Variable, and Target Service Level. After configuring the SIS policy using either the Wizard or Details View,&nbsp;the SIS Simulation&nbsp;is initiated. This simulation runs multiple components, including Stateless/Replenishment, IO Component, Inventory Optimization, and Item Location Analysis. The system processes the simulation results, which are then reviewed and applied to optimize inventory levels. This structured approach helps businesses balance safety stock investments, improve item availability, and minimize inventory costs. The Velocity Code is a classification system used in inventory management and supply chain optimization to categorize items&nbsp;based on their sales performance and movement speed. Velocity&nbsp;can be measured in various ways, including the number of units sold, cost of goods sold, revenue, profit, or a combination of these factors. This classification helps businesses prioritize inventory management, optimize stock levels, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. The Maximum Safety Stock Days serve as a threshold in the SOQ (Stock Order Quantity) calculation process. While the SIS simulation engine may suggest varying safety stock levels for each item-location based on the simulation, clients have the option to enforce a cap on the maximum safety stock days. This cap ensures that safety stock levels do not exceed a predefined limit, even if the SIS recommendation is higher, allowing for better inventory control and alignment with business policies. &nbsp; Configurations How to configure Simulation Policy?

Troubleshooting: Use the UI to view the status of each location within the Location Group. Review logs for error messages related to specific locations. Verify item location configuration and data. Restart the simulation and monitor if the problem persists. Q:&nbsp;Applied Simulation Results are not reflected in the expected service levels for specific items? The applied simulation results may not have been correctly propagated or applied due to sync issues. Troubleshooting: Use the UI to verify the simulation results have applied. Check whether item locations are correctly synced.
