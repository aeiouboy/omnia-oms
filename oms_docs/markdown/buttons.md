Service Call Buttons With the click of the button, the application calls the API URL with relevant inputs as defined in the metadata (See Extensions.ExtensionDetail.ExtensionProperties.URL). This call can be GET or POST based on the CallType (See Extensions.ExtensionDetail.ExtensionProperties.Button.callType). The API must follow the format as defined by the base application. Buttons can also be shown conditionally. (See Extensions.ExtensionDetail.ExtensionProperties.Button.ConditionURL) New Tab&nbsp;or New Window Buttons This button launches&nbsp;a new browser tab or a new window with the defined URL (See Extensions.ExtensionDetail.ExtensionProperties.URL).&nbsp; Whenever button extensions are implemented with some query params, on clicking the button,&nbsp;the UI will pass the params from the main web URL to all custom URL. Pop-Up Buttons The pop-up buttons can be used to open a new pop-up window. With a click of the button, the application opens a pop-up dialog with an embedded iframe that loads the content from the URL (See Extensions.ExtensionDetail.ExtensionProperties.URL&nbsp;here) defined. You can also control whether the base UI should be refreshed at the close of the pop-up window. For example, if you have changed the state of the entity in the pop-up which is shown in the underlying base UI, you need to refresh the base UI to reflect the updates. Using Conditional Queries for Buttons If a button should be conditionally displayed, a condition query can be added. For example: ...&quot;ConditionURL&quot;: &quot;/com-manh-cp-ext-dsgnordercomponent/api/ext/uiGrant//display/cancelledlineinfo/grant/verify&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;ConditionQuery&quot;: &quot;OrderLine.IsCancelled=true&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;URLParams&quot;: [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ParamObject&quot;: &quot;Order&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ParamName&quot;: &quot;OrderId&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ParamObject&quot;: &quot;OrderLine&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ParamName&quot;: &quot;OrderLineId&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } &nbsp; ], &nbsp; &quot;ConditionResponseData&quot;: &quot;data&quot;... As part of the response data, the API will give the following: { &nbsp; &quot;data&quot;: { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Disabled&quot;: true, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hidden&quot;: false, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ToolTip&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;OverrideText&quot;: &quot;string&quot; &nbsp; } } Conditional&nbsp;Hiding&nbsp; To conditionally disable custom buttons, the response of the conditional URL API should be: { &nbsp; &quot;data&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Disabled&quot;: true &nbsp; } } &nbsp; You can also have optional tooltip and override text in the response { &nbsp; &quot;data&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Disabled&quot;: true, &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Hidden&quot;: false, &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ToolTip&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;OverrideText&quot;: &quot;string&quot; &nbsp; } } &nbsp; The configuration should be: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ExtensionId&quot;: &quot;edit-order-header-action&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ExtensionDetail&quot;: [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ExtensionType&quot;: &quot;button&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ExtensionProperties&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Label&quot;: &quot;Save&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Sequence&quot;: 1, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;URL&quot;: https://www.google.com, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Button&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;button&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;newtab&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Style&quot;: { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;background-color&quot;: &quot;#4a90e2&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;color&quot;: &quot;#ffffff&quot;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;margin&quot;: &quot;0 0.5rem 0 0.5rem&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ConditionURL&quot;: https://demo7004666.mockable.io/installmentoptions, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ConditionResponseData&quot;: &quot;data&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } &nbsp; &nbsp; ] } Troubleshooting Edit buttons are not aligned properly in the Order Total section using the UI extension Issue: While adding three charges with the requirement to have the&nbsp;edit button (pencil icon) only for 2 charges, the alignment of the edit buttons is not proper. Troubleshooting Steps: If you have 3 fields configured in one extension, it is recommended that all the 3 buttons are configured and not just 2 of them&nbsp;since they are aligned in a table-type format. To achieve your requirement, you can use the field extension to configure just one field without the pencil icon. Buttons are misaligned when more than one button&nbsp;extensions are configured Example, when multiple icons are configured and one icon is hidden conditionally, the other icons are misaligned. Solution:&nbsp;Instead of hiding an icon, disable it conditionally. The expected response for API is { &quot;Disabled&quot; : false, &quot;Hidden&quot; : false, &quot;ToolTip&quot; : &quot;tooltip&quot;, &quot;OverrideText&quot; : &quot;Test1&quot; } Related Articles PatternsField ExtensionsExtension Util FunctionsLeft Navigation MenuBest PracticesOverviewIntercept UI API CallsiFramesBase Components
