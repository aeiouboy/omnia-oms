The symbol for the Swiss franc is &quot;CHF&quot;. The official currency code (ISO currency standard) is &quot;CHF&quot; as well. Alternatively, the abbreviation &quot;Fr.&quot; or &quot;SFr.&quot; is also widely used as a symbol.</p>\n\n<p>The currency denomination can be configured as detailed in the <a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/globalization-config$storecurrency\">localization configuration</a> guide.</p>\n\n<h3><a name=\"tax-configuration\" id=\"tax-configuration\"></a>Tax Configuration</h3>\n\n<p>Switzerland&#39;s taxation is&nbsp;value added tax (VAT) and it represents a consumption tax that is applicable to domestic goods or services and which falls under the supervision of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. Switzerland is not part of the EU; therefore, it sets its own VAT rates. As a consequence, Switzerland has the lowest VAT rate in Europe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VAT&nbsp;Rates</strong>: VAT rates are categorized into buckets below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Standard 7,7%</li>\n\t<li>Special rate 3,7 % (tourism and hotel accommodation)</li>\n\t<li>Reduced rate: 2,5 % (medicines, newspapers, food stuff, books etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>* The above VAT rates are as of Dec-2022, which might be subjected to change as per local laws.</p>\n\n<p><strong>VAT Tax Configuration</strong>:&nbsp;The information about configuring the country&nbsp;as VAT is&nbsp;detailed in the <a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/globalization-config$postaxconfig_localizationconfig\">localization configuration</a> guide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><a name=\"receipt-configuration\" id=\"receipt-configuration\"></a>Receipt Configuration</h3>\n\n<p>A receipt is a conclusive document that confirms that payment has been made for a service/goods.&nbsp;The buyer can always request a receipt, but there is no obligation for the buyer to take a receipt.&nbsp;A receipt needs to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Company information</li>\n\t<li>Date and time of issue</li>\n\t<li>Total amount paid</li>\n\t<li>Unique and sequential numbering</li>\n\t<li>VAT breakdown</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, best practice is also to include items. All additional information such as pictures, barcodes, QR codes, promotional messages, etc. can be included as there are no legal requirements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Receipt Configuration</strong>: Configuring receipts specific for a country&nbsp;is&nbsp;detailed in the <a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/globalization-config$receiptconfig_localizationconfig\">localization configuration</a> guide.</p>\n\n<h3><a name=\"services\" id=\"services\"></a><span style=\"font-size: 22px;\">Services</span></h3>\n\n<p>There are no specific services exposed for Switzerland localization.</p>\n\r\n\t  </div>\r\n </div>\r\n <div id=\"ui-page-fb-wrap\"></div>\r\n <div class=\"hiq-footer-wrap\">\r\n    \r\n                \r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
