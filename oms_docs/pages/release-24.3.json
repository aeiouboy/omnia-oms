However, there was no visibility into how often orders were allocated to the optimal location within these constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the introduction of Postgame Spotlight, Manhattan Active&reg; Omni provides that visibility, coupled with actionable insights and recommendations that can be used to reduce Adaptive Network Fulfillment (ANF) costs. You can now see how often orders are allocated to the optimal location, the most common reasons the optimal location is not allocated to, and a recommendation to resolve the reason for not choosing the optimal location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enablement: </strong>This feature is controlled by grants and a configuration that is disabled by default.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Related : </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/postgame-spotlight-dashboard\">Postgame Spotlight</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/postgame-spotlight-dashboard$configuration\">Postgame Spotlight Configuration</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5 data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><a name=\"override-protection-quantity-on-availability-rules-and-network\" id=\"override-protection-quantity-on-availability-rules-and-network\"></a><strong>Override Protection Quantity on Availability Rules and Network</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Manhattan Active&reg; Omni users can now override the on-hand protection quantity specified in the availability rules, as well as the protection quantity defined at the network level for specific items, styles, product classes, departments, and brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enablement: </strong>This feature is controlled by a configuration that is disabled by default.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Related : </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/how-is-availability-computed$how-protection-override-works\">Protection Override</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/inventory_configuration$protection-override-configuration\">Protection Override Configuration</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5 data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><a name=\"available-to-commerce-atc-ui-refresh\" id=\"available-to-commerce-atc-ui-refresh\"></a><strong>Available to Commerce (ATC) UI Refresh</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The Available To Commerce (ATC) has a new look, but with all the same powerful features you know and love.

However, there was no visibility into how often orders were allocated to the optimal location within these constraints. With the introduction of Postgame Spotlight, Manhattan Active® Omni provides that visibility, coupled with actionable insights and recommendations that can be used to reduce Adaptive Network Fulfillment (ANF) costs. You can now see how often orders are allocated to the optimal location, the most common reasons the optimal location is not allocated to, and a recommendation to resolve the reason for not choosing the optimal location.

Related Links: Process Configuration Retail Delivery Fee - Receipt updates Various states including Colorado, and, most recently Minnesota - as of July 1, 2024 - have adopted Retail Delivery fees.  Typically these are flat amounts which are charged once per transaction when goods are shipped into that state. In case of CO and MN, the fee must be presented separately on the POS receipt, NOT combined into the total tax amount as are other typical local taxes or PIF amounts. It's required by law that the retailers must show the total of the retail delivery fees that's imposed to the customer's transaction as a separate line items and distinct from the sales price and any other taxes or fees. We made generic changes to base receipt templates to adhere to this upcoming law for Minnesota and it is also applicable to Colarado Retail Delivery Fees.  These template changes were designed to work when the system is configured to use Vertex. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release.  Existing customers who have custom receipts need to adopt the latest of the below jrxml templates from base to pick these changes.
