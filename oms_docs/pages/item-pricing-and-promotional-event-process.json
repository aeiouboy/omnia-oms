The benefit price is prorated across the kit items i.e. qualifiers and target.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Example: A retailer may sell slacks and jackets as separate SKUs but wish to offer a deal on Suits. The ‘Suit’ is not a separate SKU but a kit consisting of 1 pair slacks, 1 jacket. Fixed Price Kit promotions allow you to define the kit - in this case, the suit - as 1 item product class Slacks, 1 item product class Jackets, and assign a fixed promotional price to the combination of both together - say, 199.00 for the two items. This is different from the type of fixed price deal in which each item receives the same fixed price - i.e., slacks for 59.99.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">In this way, you can make final prices for a product or group of products constant for a period of time, regardless of any changes in unit price. This is in addition to current item promotional functionality, which allows you to configure discount percentage or an absolute discount amount as benefit type.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Key highlights of fixed price kit promotions</h6>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Fixed price kit promotion can be created/configured as non-stackable combo item deal with template as Q1+T10+B6.

Fixed price kit itself cannot be defined as ‘stackable’.</li>\r\n\t<li>If a stackable deal is mutually exclusive to fixed price kit promotion which is already applied to transaction, then this stackable deal should be skipped. Note that this does not apply for shipping deals.</li>\r\n\t<li>As with other item deals, Fixed price kit promotion can be associated with coupon or offer number, customer attributes, employee attributes, and payment types as well to trigger the deal.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"shipping-promotions\" id=\"shipping-promotions\"></a>Shipping Promotions</h4>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"462\">\r\n<p>Shipping promotions are only calculated if the Shipping and Handling component is called due to a ship to address fulfillment - i.e, if a Shipping Group of items being shipped to a shared address via same shipping method is present in the Sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. As with other deals, Shipping promotions can be triggered by configured conditions known as \"Qualifiers\".&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal can be directed toward a specific Shipping method - i.e., a deal could target 50% off Standard Ground but not overnight shipping.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basic Shipping qualifying patterns include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Buy Anything</li>\r\n\t<li>Spend A</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>2. The \"Target\" for a Shipping Deal is always the shipping fee for the qualifying fulfillment group (not necessarily individual line items as a group may contain more than one item).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The discount effect (the \"Benefit\") is also configurable and can be: Free, percentage off, dollar amount off, or fixed amount</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because this logic is completely dynamic, the entire cart 'basket' is sent for re-evaluation each time the shipping component is called</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For example: The shipping promotion may be configured when the transaction subtotal is over $100.00. If a $25 item is added to the cart as a ship to address item, then shipping and handling component will call the promotion engine to see if the fulfillment group qualifies for any deals - which it does not in this case.</li>\r\n\t<li>However, if a second item of $75 is added to the same fulfillment, the subtotal now may qualify for shipping promotion, and therefore the eligibility is re-evaluated when the second item is added.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tip\"><strong>Note</strong>: If a fulfillment group has had the shipping charge overridden manually, shipping and handling will not check for a shipping promotion. Groups with manually assigned shipping amounts are not eligible for Shipping Deals.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tip\"><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>The transaction level discounts are more treated as overrides for the existing promotions.&nbsp;When a promo is already applied and the user applies for a transaction level discount, it overrides the applied promo and overrides it with an applied discount.</div>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"coupons\" id=\"coupons\"></a>Coupons</h4>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"8511\">\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"8840\">\r\n<p>Collecting coupons at POS-</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Coupons can be scanned or manually typed in to the Cart at any point within a transaction.&nbsp;\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Navigate to the More Menu and then tap&nbsp;View Coupons to view all the entered coupons by a user at any point of time.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Once a coupon is entered in, the price basket API will be called to submit the entered information to the promo engine.

These retailers often provide additional discounts to the customers if they use their specific cards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><a name=\"payment-promotions-functionality\" id=\"payment-promotions-functionality\"></a>Payment Promotions Functionality</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Payment promo is like any other promo of type Item/Order/Shipping which compete within the same group. This promo discount can also be stacked. The promo discount can be configured for Order, Item or Shipping. It can also be tied along with any of the ongoing event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example: A promo discount of 10% can be configured for an Order Subtotal of more than $100 only if paid by PLCC.&nbsp; So, if the customer purchase more than 100.00 and decides to pay using the PLCC then the order gets a discount of 10% on the entire amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if the customer decides to use a different payment type which doesn't qualify for a deal, then the order total is re-evaluated, and the applied 10% discount is removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note: Split tender </strong>- Payment deals are evaluated based on the FIRST payment type used.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the example above, if the order total is more than $100 and the customer decides to pay only $20.00&nbsp;using the PLCC&nbsp;the promotion is still applied if the first payment type used is the PLCC regardless of subsequent payment types used to tender the remaining balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion is not removed from the order when the remaining amount is paid using a different tender type.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, if the first payment type is 20.00 CASH and PLCC is tendered second, the promotion IS NOT applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note: Payment deals for 100% off</strong> - In the event that the retailer defines the payment deal in such a way that the balance goes to 0.00 (ex,&nbsp;deal is Pay by PLCC and get anything in Women's Free, and the purchase is strictly Women's)&nbsp;please note - the deal will be triggered based on the chosen payment type, but technically there will actually be no payment involved, since the balance is 0.00.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, users are advised not to create 100% off payment deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"info\">Note: PLCC here is used only for explanation. The feature supports all <strong>custom</strong> payment types.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply payment promotion during POS order capture flow, customer should choose to pay through the payment type which is associated to the promo deal. This payment type is passed on to the order. To enable this, following configuration and transaction entities are added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. \"OrderPaymentMethod\" New Child entity under Order is added to persist the payment types. This is treated as qualifier for payment related promotion evaluation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Mod type added to “Order”</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;“OrderPaymentMethod::PaymentType\"</li>\r\n\t<li>\"Order::OrderPaymentMethod::Remove\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Promotion Configurations: Enable Payment Promotions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. <strong>The payment promotion does not get evaluated for the following payment types, as they each have a dedicated 'base' flow which does not allow for order pricing re-evaluation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Credit Card</li>\r\n\t<li>Debit Card</li>\r\n\t<li>Gift Card</li>\r\n\t<li>Cash</li>\r\n\t<li>Check</li>\r\n\t<li>Pay by link</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><a name=\"pos-ui-flow\" id=\"pos-ui-flow\"></a><strong>POS UI Flow</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>When users proceed to checkout, a \"Promotion\" label appears under each eligible payment type. This label is displayed for all payment methods associated with active promotional deals. Upon selecting a payment type linked to a promotion, the payment page will show the original balance with a strike-through and display the discounted amount due. If the payment promotion does not get applied, the amount due does&nbsp;not change.&nbsp;Users can then click the \"Pay\" button to complete the transaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a customer chooses to pay with a payment type linked to a promotional deal, the order summary reflects the payment type and applies the promotion to the total; however, if the initial payment fails (e.g., due to network issues or card expiry), switching to a non-promotional payment option re-evaluates the order total without any promo benefits. If the initial payment is a partial payment using a promo-linked card, the deal still applies to the order, even if the remaining amount is paid through a different method. Conversely, if the initial partial payment is made with a non-promo payment type, no deal is applied, regardless of subsequent payment methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The payment promotion is applicable to all types of orders- in-store and save the sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;In an exchange scenario, if there is a positive balance and the user selects a payment type with a promotion that results in a negative balance, the system should issue a refund to the default refund payment type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h6 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; line-height: 2em; color: rgb(61, 61, 61); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 450; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"><strong>Coupon and Offer Number compatibility with Payment Deals</strong></h6>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"3745\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(61, 61, 61); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 450; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; visibility: visible; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; z-index: auto;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; line-height: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\">In case the payment promo deal is tied to the coupon or offer number, user needs to add the number at the Cart screen.

These coupon code can be used by customer in the upcoming transaction. This type of promotion brings three main business advantages&nbsp;to the retailers&nbsp;which are Compelling customers to return, Exclusive items and incentives, and Available for a limited period in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Compelling</strong>:&nbsp;Motivate customers to go back to your store. For ex: “buy one, get 50% off on next” or 25 percent off everything if order total exceed $200 if they bring back these bounceback coupons to redeem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exclusive</strong>:&nbsp;Is there an in-demand item you could offer before your competitors do? For example, Is there a item your shoppers could only get from your store, such as bunny bobblehead dolls before Easter, specially designed pendants before Mother’s Day, or custom-shaped chocolates for dads and grads? Your bounce back promotion could emphasize the exclusivity of the item and even include discounts by using these coupons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Available for a limited time</strong>:&nbsp; Whatever you offer, make sure it’s available for a limited time only, and on a future date so they can’t use it same-day if the objective of a bounce back promotion is to get customers to return to your store. Make the offer for the near future so your customers will remember the offer and come back.&nbsp;Busy times are ideal for promoting bounce back offers. They can help you get customers – and sales – to bounce back during traditionally slower business periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bounceback&nbsp;coupon can be configured to be issued for a coupon code or a offer number deal. If it is for a offer number deal, then every time&nbsp;a transaction qualifies for bounceback a new offernumber is retrieved from the offernumber 'bucket' associated to the redeeming deal, and issued as a bounceback coupon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Salient features of bounceback&nbsp;coupon promotion type below:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If a transaction qualifies for bounceback&nbsp;coupons, then its&nbsp;printed on the customer receipt,&nbsp;which&nbsp;contains&nbsp;coupon barcode, coupon code and coupon description.</li>\r\n\t<li>The coupon code or offer number printed as part of bounceback can represent a redeeming deal&nbsp;of any promo type i.e. combo item promo, combo order promo, single item promo or&nbsp;shipping promo.</li>\r\n\t<li>The redeeming deals for coupon code or offer number&nbsp;must exist before creating a bounceback coupon deal.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bounceback coupons are always stackable. (If retailer wish to selectively stack bounceback coupon using tags and defining mutual exclusive tags then it is&nbsp;supported as well.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exceptional cases for bounceback coupon:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If a transaction which issued&nbsp;bounceback&nbsp;coupons is post voided, then the bounceback coupons are still valid, we dont reserve or undo already issued coupons or offer numbers.</li>\r\n\t<li>If some or all items in a transaction which issued&nbsp;bounceback&nbsp;coupons is returned or exchanged, then the bounceback coupons are still valid;&nbsp;we don't reserve or undo already issued coupons or offer numbers.</li>\r\n\t<li>The deals for coupon code or offernumber&nbsp;must exist before creating a bounceback coupon, but there is no smart validation if the deal containing the coupon code&nbsp;or offer number is deleted.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bounceback promo type is currently only supported and tested with Selling channel as \"Store\".</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Use case of bounceback coupon: </strong>Below is a example of a bounceback coupon but its not limited to only this scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Config Data</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Create a combo order promo deal with Coupon required as Yes and Coupon code = \"BUNDLE20\" if customer spend more than&nbsp;$200, then&nbsp;20% is provided as&nbsp;benefit on entire transaction. The deal is valid from Jan-01&nbsp;to Feb-13 of next year.</li>\r\n\t<li>Create a bounceback coupon deal which will issue a COUPON i.e.&nbsp;\"BUNDLE20\" if customer buys anything of order total more than&nbsp;$50 between Nov-01 thru Dec-31.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Scenario: If customer buys some items worth more than $50 between Nov-01 thru Dec-31 then a bounceback coupon&nbsp;\"BUNDLE20\" is printed on cuustomer receipt. The customer can come back anytime between&nbsp;Jan-01&nbsp;to Feb-13 and if customer buys anything more than $200 in single transaction then he can avail or redeem&nbsp;\"BUNDLE20\" by showing the customer receipt and get 20% off on the transaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"promotions-applied-to-base-price-for-markdown-items\" id=\"promotions-applied-to-base-price-for-markdown-items\"></a><a id=\"MarkDownPromo-Process\" name=\"MarkDownPromo-Process\"></a>Promotions Applied to Base Price for Markdown items</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Some retailers have long running standard discount programs such as employee discounts 50% off. Over time as the selling&nbsp;price&nbsp;of items are dropped, since promotion are always run on selling price, the combination of item price&nbsp;mark down with the employee discount becomes inappropriately generous.<br>\r\nEx.&nbsp; Emp discount deal is 50% off.&nbsp; For 100.00 item whose selling price is dropped to 60.00 - combined with the employee discount this item now sells for 30.00. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To resolve the above limitation, we have flag on promotion configuration i.e. \"Apply on base price\", this will provide an ability to allow&nbsp;promotion to be configured&nbsp;to apply against the item base&nbsp;price instead of the selling price. Employee Discount deals defined this way would consistently be applied against the 'original' 100.00 price, regardless of Item price mark downs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simple example shows the basic idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Example -&nbsp;Item A , Base Price Deals 1 and 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Base Price = 100.00,&nbsp;Selling Price = 75.00</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Deal 1 = buy Item A, get 20% off Base Price - Deal 1 WILL NOT apply because current Selling price 75.00 is already lower than 20% off 100.00.</li>\r\n\t<li>Deal 2 = buy Item A, get 30% off Base Price - Deal 2 WILL&nbsp;apply because 30% off 100.00 = 70.00 which is lower than 75.00 selling price</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The deal will show on UI and receipts as 75.00-5.00 (mathematically equivalent to 100-30.00).&nbsp; As stated, the 100.00 base price is not shown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This functionality is available only for limited type of promotional deals.&nbsp; Please check the restriction below</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>This flag \"Apply on base price\" will only be applicable to combo item deal</li>\r\n\t<li>This flag is shown on ui only when&nbsp;\"Include Sale Item\"&nbsp;= true</li>\r\n\t<li>This type of promotion deal are always non-stackable. i.e when&nbsp;\"Apply on base price\" then stackable = false always.</li>\r\n\t<li>If item base price is not defined, then this promotion is not applied.

If Base Price = 100, selling price = 75, and Base Price deal \"30% off Base Price\" is applied, <strong>the final price will show up as 70.00 which will look like 5.00 off 75.00</strong>, not 30.00 off 100.00. &nbsp;Mathematically same result either way.</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>On UI and on receipt, we will continue to show “Promotion Short Desc“ i.e. “30% off Base Price“.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<ol>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Therefore, Retailer should be sure to capture accurate detail in the promo short description as above, since the&nbsp;$100 (Base Price) deal basis is not shown on UI or receipts.&nbsp; Otherwise customers may question why 30% only got them $5.00 off their $75.00 - the answer is, it was calculated on the BASE price (100) but that's not shown on UI or receipts.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"services\" id=\"services\"></a><a id=\"Services\" name=\"Services\"></a>Services</h3>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"\" style=\"left: 15px; top: 1913.68px;\">The APIs listed below are related to Item Pricing and Promotional Events at POS and referenced in this document.

In addition, the retailer can create time-bound automatic discounts called Promotional Deals and these will also be evaluated by the Price Basket Controller. Note: The Promotional Events feature currently does not support the use of the Quantity key. Use the UI configuration as described in POS Cart/In-Store Purchase POS Configuration, and see the section on General Cart Configurations for how to remove the quantity key option from the Cart menus. To capture data correctly, all items should be scanned individually (i.e.. quantity 1 for all line items). High Level Price and Promotional Evaluation at POS To determine automatic promotional discounts, if any, cart information including but not limited to: item identities and attributes, customer status, employee's job class, location (store) Id, selling channel, and order merchandise subtotal are sent via the Price Promo - Price Basket Controller for price and promotional evaluation when certain modifications are performed to the order. Note: Item pricing occurs before promotional evaluation. These modifications include but are not limited to: add/void a line item, item modifications such as price override/discounting, and adding/modifying the active customer.  See Order Orchestration Configuration for further information regarding actions which can be configured to trigger price/promo evaluation. Note: Promotional deals only interact with positive merchandise items. Return, nonmerchandise, VAS, and Gift Card items are not considered for promotional deals. Pricing Evaluation and Sale Price The price of an item is determined by referring to the Item Price entity and retrieving the 'Selling Price' for the lowest ranking record for that item. If Location Id is populated on the Item Price record and if 'Selling Location Id' is populated on the order header, the lowest ranking Item Price record matching the Item Id and Location Id is selected (taking precedence over Item Price records that match the item but do not have location id). All Item Price records must include an Effective Start Date and Effective End Date. Any records that are expired or not yet active are not considered. The Behavior After End Date attribute on the item price record indicates what should happen after a price record expires. The value can either be 'Ignore' or 'Alert.' If set to 'Ignore,' then the expired record is not used and no alert is sent. If set to 'Alert' then the item record is not used and an outbound message is sent. Base Price is an optional field and does not impact item pricing. Rather, the Base Price is used to derive the \"sale\" status of the item. If the Selling Price is less than the Base Price, then the item is considered 'on sale.' The Price Basket controller supports requesting the price only once for each item, as it is not necessary to re-evaluate the Selling Price with every cart action which may require promotion evaluation/re-evaluation. Note: S&H component has a check to filter out lines with basePrice or SellingPrice that are null or blank, therefore the item price should have basePrice and SellingPrice for S&H Promotion calculation if customer is using MAO base promotion engine. Note: a deployment level configuration property \"itemprice.isIndexingOnImportRequired\"  should be enabled. Work with Manhattan team to get this set correctly for your implementation. Promotional Evaluation Promotional deals are automatic discounts which can be assigned to merchandise items within the transaction based on attributes of the deal which are established in various promotional deal entities. For details of these records, see Item Pricing and Promotional Events Configuration page. In brief, 1. Promotional deals can be triggered by configured conditions known as \"Qualifiers\", including but not limited to: Presence of specific items in specific quantities - the items can be identified specifically by itemId or by one or more other attributes, such as storeDepartment, productClass, color and so on. Transaction merchandise subtotal is greater than or equal to a configured amount. 2. Once triggered, deals are applied to \"Target\" items, which could be the same items which triggered them, or different items. 3. The discount effect (the \"Benefit\") is also configurable and can be: a percentage off, a dollar amount off, or a fixed price. Mix and Match promotions can be configured to allow qualifiers from different categories to be the trigger for a promotion.  Example: Buy 2 women's tops and 1 women's pant, get a belt free or buy 2 women's tops and 1 women's pant, get 50% off the 2 women's tops. Because this logic is completely dynamic, the entire cart 'basket' is sent for re-evaluation each time a configured order modtype occurs. For example, a deal may be triggered if a transaction subtotal exceeds 100.00. If a 10.00 item is added to the cart, or voided from the cart, it is not sufficient to send only the specific item information - the entire contents of the cart is sent to determine if the 100.00 qualifier threshold requires that a discount be added (because the added 10.00 pushes the transaction over the threshold), or removed (because the removed item moves the subtotal under the threshold). Selective stackability During the promotional evaluation, some of the stackable deals can be excluded by defined tags and exclusions. Selective stackability is applicable to combo item, single item, combo order deals which can be stackable or non-stackable. Selective stackability can be defined across deal type. For example, user can configure a stackable item deal to not be applied when a item or order deal is applied. Selective stackability does not apply to Shipping promotion. Check below the steps for selective stacking. Create deals (Combo Item, Combo Order or Single item deals) which are stackable or non-stackable. Create tags  i.e. tag name and description. Associate tags created above for deals which need to be mutual exclusive For example, if a user has a created combo order deal, deal 1 and deal 2 (stackable or non stackable), and when deal 1 is applied, and user want deal 2 to not be stacked on deal 1, then associate deal 1 to tag 1 and deal 2 to tag 2 and make them mutual exclusive. Mutual exclusive can be defined through tags by defining tag 2 in the exclusion list of tag 1. With the above configuration of deals, association of deals with tags and tag exclusion, when the promotion engine is evaluated, and then after applying deal 1, deal 2 will be skipped and only deal 1 will be applied. Detailed Order-Promo Flow Pre-emptive Promotional Prompting - Promo Hints An order is evaluated for the promo deal every time an item is added/removed, quantity updated, price changes and so on. During this process, the eligible deal, qualifier and the target items are identified. If the cart is found to be eligible for the promo, system ascertains the qualifier and target items/amount and what is the gap to get the deal applied. In addition to this basic functionality the promotional events feature allows the retailer to configure 'hints' for a promo deal for which some qualifiers are present but that has not been actually triggered yet. The pre-emptive prompting 'hints' have independent triggers to the actual deal qualifier, but logically they should be related. For example, a deal may require user to buy 3 items. The preemptive 'hint' can be configured to display after 1 or more items are purchased. The 'hint' will appear after purchase of 1 item, 2 items, and after the 3rd item the deal itself may be triggered after which the 'hints' would no longer appear. If the deal is set up for prompting: system checks if the threshold specified are met withe current order data. If so, the prompt text for each configured channel is persisted on order. POS cart UI displays the text and the image set for store channel. User gets to view the prompt in the following flows. Tap the More Menu >> Promo Deal View details on the Toast message Tap Check out. Ability to view the suggested promotion on checkout is configurable under storeCommonConfig. If enabled, and there exist at least one suggested promo, the prompt displays.  If the retailer does not want to view this, it can be disabled and proceeded to the Summary screen. User actions available on the prompt are: Go back to the cart Suspend the transaction to allow the customer to make additional purchases Proceed to Checkout Special Promotion Types Fixed price kit promotions A Fixed Price kit/set is a promotion that sets the total price of one or more items to a configured price for the entire package or kit. The benefit price is prorated across the kit items i.e. qualifiers and target. Example: A retailer may sell slacks and jackets as separate SKUs but wish to offer a deal on Suits. The ‘Suit’ is not a separate SKU but a kit consisting of 1 pair slacks, 1 jacket. Fixed Price Kit promotions allow you to define the kit - in this case, the suit - as 1 item product class Slacks, 1 item product class Jackets, and assign a fixed promotional price to the combination of both together - say, 199.00 for the two items. This is different from the type of fixed price deal in which each item receives the same fixed price - i.e., slacks for 59.99. In this way, you can make final prices for a product or group of products constant for a period of time, regardless of any changes in unit price. This is in addition to current item promotional functionality, which allows you to configure discount percentage or an absolute discount amount as benefit type. Key highlights of fixed price kit promotions Fixed price kit promotion can be created/configured as non-stackable combo item deal with template as Q1+T10+B6. Find more details on configuration here. For T10 as target, qualifier and target is same. Hence, The Min and Max target unit price is disabled for T10. Prorate to Qualifier on benefit (B6) is always turned on and disabled on UI. If stackable is turned ON, then fixed price kit deal cannot be created. i.e T10 target will not be available. Check the no special treatment below Benefit max redemption is treated same as any other deal, Check the no special treatment below. All combo item deal along with fixed price kit deal will compete with each other and best deal wins. All valid stackable deals will be applied on top of fixed price kit promotion. Fixed price kit itself cannot be defined as ‘stackable’. If a stackable deal is mutually exclusive to fixed price kit promotion which is already applied to transaction, then this stackable deal should be skipped. Note that this does not apply for shipping deals. As with other item deals, Fixed price kit promotion can be associated with coupon or offer number, customer attributes, employee attributes, and payment types as well to trigger the deal. Shipping Promotions Shipping promotions are only calculated if the Shipping and Handling component is called due to a ship to address fulfillment - i.e, if a Shipping Group of items being shipped to a shared address via same shipping method is present in the Sale. 1. As with other deals, Shipping promotions can be triggered by configured conditions known as \"Qualifiers\".  The deal can be directed toward a specific Shipping method - i.e., a deal could target 50% off Standard Ground but not overnight shipping. Basic Shipping qualifying patterns include: Buy Anything Spend A 2. The \"Target\" for a Shipping Deal is always the shipping fee for the qualifying fulfillment group (not necessarily individual line items as a group may contain more than one item). 3. The discount effect (the \"Benefit\") is also configurable and can be: Free, percentage off, dollar amount off, or fixed amount Because this logic is completely dynamic, the entire cart 'basket' is sent for re-evaluation each time the shipping component is called For example: The shipping promotion may be configured when the transaction subtotal is over $100.00. If a $25 item is added to the cart as a ship to address item, then shipping and handling component will call the promotion engine to see if the fulfillment group qualifies for any deals - which it does not in this case. However, if a second item of $75 is added to the same fulfillment, the subtotal now may qualify for shipping promotion, and therefore the eligibility is re-evaluated when the second item is added. Note: If a fulfillment group has had the shipping charge overridden manually, shipping and handling will not check for a shipping promotion. Groups with manually assigned shipping amounts are not eligible for Shipping Deals. Note: The transaction level discounts are more treated as overrides for the existing promotions. When a promo is already applied and the user applies for a transaction level discount, it overrides the applied promo and overrides it with an applied discount. Coupons Collecting coupons at POS- Coupons can be scanned or manually typed in to the Cart at any point within a transaction. Navigate to the More Menu and then tap View Coupons to view all the entered coupons by a user at any point of time. Once a coupon is entered in, the price basket API will be called to submit the entered information to the promo engine. The coupon will continue to be submitted during all subsequent calls as additional items or coupons are entered. Tap the Checkout button, to view the final list of applied and non-applied coupons. All coupons display the Coupon ID, as well as the short description of the deal. Then tap the OK button to navigate to the Order Summary screen. All applied coupons are displayed on the receipt under the Coupon section. One-time use coupon (Offer number) Once the one-time use coupons (offer numbers) are generated as part of the deal, it can be downloaded and collected at the POS terminal to get the benefit. This workflow is similar to coupons. Offer numbers can be scanned or manually typed into the cart at any point within a transaction. To enter offer numbers manually use existing \"Enter Coupons\" screen on POS UI. All valid scanned or manually typed Offer numbers can be viewed at any time by the user by navigating to View Coupons from More Menu. Once a offer number is entered in the POS system on UI, the \"addCouponToCart\" API will check if this is a valid offer number in database (offer number tracker) if it already used and/or on elastic if its valid. Upon this validation offer number will continue to be submitted during all subsequent calls as additional items or offer numbers are entered. Since the offer number is validate in elastic which is not available when store is offline. In offline mode, offer number is not supported. If there are few more deals available using other promotional event, the best deal will be applied. Moving to the Checkout button, will fetch the final list of applied and non-applied offer numbers. Upon acknowledgement from user, the screen will navigate to the Order Summary screen. All applied offer numbers are updated in the database (offer number tracker) as used upon order confirmation. Please note that if orders consisting of offer number promotion are created outside of store application , then during order confirmation, send \"ChargeSubType\": \"OfferNumber\" to tracker the offer number consumption. The applied offer numbers are displayed on the receipt under the existing coupons section. Case Sensitivity - Entering Coupon data Coupons are case sensitive.  COUPON001 is understood as a diifferent coupon from Coupon001 which is different from CouPon001.  Please keep this in mind when configuring the coupon for a deal, and when entering coupons by hand. Case Sensitivity - Entering Offer Number data Offer numbers are case insensitive.  Mtuy85YXtBPhx0w is understood as the same offer number as mTUY85yxTbpHX0W and MTUY85YXTBPHX0W.  Offer numbers can only be configured with upper case letters, but keep this in mind when entering them by hand. Typically, an offer number is expected to be scanned,  in any case, but they can be entered by typing. Viewing transactions containing offer numbers on electronic Journal All transactions having valid and applied offer numbers are recorded in the system and can be searched using the search fields from Electronic Journal. Turn Promotions flag or Coupons flag on electronic journal > transaction search screen (Use Coupon flag to be specific) Upon selection of Coupon Flag, if you want all the transactions containing coupons and offer number then hit search to fetch the results. The transaction details will contain Charge SubType and display this as \"OfferNumber\" if the deal was for offer number. If you want to fetch a transaction for a specific offer number then enter the offer number in \"Coupon Code\" enter field and tap search This will fetch you only the transaction on which this offer number was applied. And the transaction details will contain Charge SubType and display as \"OfferNumber\". Offer Number Workflow Payment Promotion The Payment Promotion feature provides the ability to configure and execute promotion deals based on the tender types used to make the payment. Many of the retailers have their own cards which can be used to make payments at their stores. These retailers often provide additional discounts to the customers if they use their specific cards. Payment Promotions Functionality Payment promo is like any other promo of type Item/Order/Shipping which compete within the same group. This promo discount can also be stacked. The promo discount can be configured for Order, Item or Shipping. It can also be tied along with any of the ongoing event. For example: A promo discount of 10% can be configured for an Order Subtotal of more than $100 only if paid by PLCC.  So, if the customer purchase more than 100.00 and decides to pay using the PLCC then the order gets a discount of 10% on the entire amount. However, if the customer decides to use a different payment type which doesn't qualify for a deal, then the order total is re-evaluated, and the applied 10% discount is removed. Note: Split tender - Payment deals are evaluated based on the FIRST payment type used.  In the example above, if the order total is more than $100 and the customer decides to pay only $20.00 using the PLCC the promotion is still applied if the first payment type used is the PLCC regardless of subsequent payment types used to tender the remaining balance.  Promotion is not removed from the order when the remaining amount is paid using a different tender type.  Conversely, if the first payment type is 20.00 CASH and PLCC is tendered second, the promotion IS NOT applied. Note: Payment deals for 100% off - In the event that the retailer defines the payment deal in such a way that the balance goes to 0.00 (ex, deal is Pay by PLCC and get anything in Women's Free, and the purchase is strictly Women's) please note - the deal will be triggered based on the chosen payment type, but technically there will actually be no payment involved, since the balance is 0.00.  For obvious reasons, users are advised not to create 100% off payment deals. Note: PLCC here is used only for explanation. The feature supports all custom payment types. To apply payment promotion during POS order capture flow, customer should choose to pay through the payment type which is associated to the promo deal. This payment type is passed on to the order. To enable this, following configuration and transaction entities are added. 1. \"OrderPaymentMethod\" New Child entity under Order is added to persist the payment types. This is treated as qualifier for payment related promotion evaluation. 2. Mod type added to “Order” “OrderPaymentMethod::PaymentType\" \"Order::OrderPaymentMethod::Remove\" 3. Promotion Configurations: Enable Payment Promotions 4. The payment promotion does not get evaluated for the following payment types, as they each have a dedicated 'base' flow which does not allow for order pricing re-evaluation. Credit Card Debit Card Gift Card Cash Check Pay by link POS UI Flow When users proceed to checkout, a \"Promotion\" label appears under each eligible payment type. This label is displayed for all payment methods associated with active promotional deals. Upon selecting a payment type linked to a promotion, the payment page will show the original balance with a strike-through and display the discounted amount due. If the payment promotion does not get applied, the amount due does not change. Users can then click the \"Pay\" button to complete the transaction. When a customer chooses to pay with a payment type linked to a promotional deal, the order summary reflects the payment type and applies the promotion to the total; however, if the initial payment fails (e.g., due to network issues or card expiry), switching to a non-promotional payment option re-evaluates the order total without any promo benefits. If the initial payment is a partial payment using a promo-linked card, the deal still applies to the order, even if the remaining amount is paid through a different method. Conversely, if the initial partial payment is made with a non-promo payment type, no deal is applied, regardless of subsequent payment methods. The payment promotion is applicable to all types of orders- in-store and save the sale. Note: In an exchange scenario, if there is a positive balance and the user selects a payment type with a promotion that results in a negative balance, the system should issue a refund to the default refund payment type. Coupon and Offer Number compatibility with Payment Deals In case the payment promo deal is tied to the coupon or offer number, user needs to add the number at the Cart screen. There is no option to include the coupon or offer number once the user has navigated out of the Cart screen using the checkout. From the Order Summary screen user needs to go back to the Cart screen again to initiate the coupon or offer number. Offline/Edge Support In the edge mode only the payment types which are permitted offline will be listed. Void Payment In case of Void payment, system checks if this was the only payment made using promo payment type.  If yes, Order Payment Method gets reset and promotion is re-evaluated.

Bounceback Coupon Promo type as \"bounceback coupon\" provides the ability to configure and issue bounceback coupons based on existing qualification rules to provide benefit in the form of a coupon barcode printed on customer receipt. These coupon code can be used by customer in the upcoming transaction. This type of promotion brings three main business advantages to the retailers which are Compelling customers to return, Exclusive items and incentives, and Available for a limited period in time. Compelling: Motivate customers to go back to your store. For ex: “buy one, get 50% off on next” or 25 percent off everything if order total exceed $200 if they bring back these bounceback coupons to redeem. Exclusive: Is there an in-demand item you could offer before your competitors do? For example, Is there a item your shoppers could only get from your store, such as bunny bobblehead dolls before Easter, specially designed pendants before Mother’s Day, or custom-shaped chocolates for dads and grads? Your bounce back promotion could emphasize the exclusivity of the item and even include discounts by using these coupons. Available for a limited time:  Whatever you offer, make sure it’s available for a limited time only, and on a future date so they can’t use it same-day if the objective of a bounce back promotion is to get customers to return to your store. Make the offer for the near future so your customers will remember the offer and come back. Busy times are ideal for promoting bounce back offers. They can help you get customers – and sales – to bounce back during traditionally slower business periods. Bounceback coupon can be configured to be issued for a coupon code or a offer number deal. If it is for a offer number deal, then every time a transaction qualifies for bounceback a new offernumber is retrieved from the offernumber 'bucket' associated to the redeeming deal, and issued as a bounceback coupon. Salient features of bounceback coupon promotion type below: If a transaction qualifies for bounceback coupons, then its printed on the customer receipt, which contains coupon barcode, coupon code and coupon description. The coupon code or offer number printed as part of bounceback can represent a redeeming deal of any promo type i.e. combo item promo, combo order promo, single item promo or shipping promo. The redeeming deals for coupon code or offer number must exist before creating a bounceback coupon deal. Bounceback coupons are always stackable. (If retailer wish to selectively stack bounceback coupon using tags and defining mutual exclusive tags then it is supported as well.) Exceptional cases for bounceback coupon: If a transaction which issued bounceback coupons is post voided, then the bounceback coupons are still valid, we dont reserve or undo already issued coupons or offer numbers. If some or all items in a transaction which issued bounceback coupons is returned or exchanged, then the bounceback coupons are still valid; we don't reserve or undo already issued coupons or offer numbers. The deals for coupon code or offernumber must exist before creating a bounceback coupon, but there is no smart validation if the deal containing the coupon code or offer number is deleted. Bounceback promo type is currently only supported and tested with Selling channel as \"Store\". Use case of bounceback coupon: Below is a example of a bounceback coupon but its not limited to only this scenario. Config Data Create a combo order promo deal with Coupon required as Yes and Coupon code = \"BUNDLE20\" if customer spend more than $200, then 20% is provided as benefit on entire transaction. The deal is valid from Jan-01 to Feb-13 of next year. Create a bounceback coupon deal which will issue a COUPON i.e. \"BUNDLE20\" if customer buys anything of order total more than $50 between Nov-01 thru Dec-31. Scenario: If customer buys some items worth more than $50 between Nov-01 thru Dec-31 then a bounceback coupon \"BUNDLE20\" is printed on cuustomer receipt. The customer can come back anytime between Jan-01 to Feb-13 and if customer buys anything more than $200 in single transaction then he can avail or redeem \"BUNDLE20\" by showing the customer receipt and get 20% off on the transaction. Promotions Applied to Base Price for Markdown items Some retailers have long running standard discount programs such as employee discounts 50% off. Over time as the selling price of items are dropped, since promotion are always run on selling price, the combination of item price mark down with the employee discount becomes inappropriately generous. Ex.  Emp discount deal is 50% off.  For 100.00 item whose selling price is dropped to 60.00 - combined with the employee discount this item now sells for 30.00. To resolve the above limitation, we have flag on promotion configuration i.e. \"Apply on base price\", this will provide an ability to allow promotion to be configured to apply against the item base price instead of the selling price. Employee Discount deals defined this way would consistently be applied against the 'original' 100.00 price, regardless of Item price mark downs. Simple example shows the basic idea. Example - Item A , Base Price Deals 1 and 2 Base Price = 100.00, Selling Price = 75.00 Deal 1 = buy Item A, get 20% off Base Price - Deal 1 WILL NOT apply because current Selling price 75.00 is already lower than 20% off 100.00. Deal 2 = buy Item A, get 30% off Base Price - Deal 2 WILL apply because 30% off 100.00 = 70.00 which is lower than 75.00 selling price The deal will show on UI and receipts as 75.00-5.00 (mathematically equivalent to 100-30.00).  As stated, the 100.00 base price is not shown. This functionality is available only for limited type of promotional deals.  Please check the restriction below This flag \"Apply on base price\" will only be applicable to combo item deal This flag is shown on ui only when \"Include Sale Item\" = true This type of promotion deal are always non-stackable. i.e when \"Apply on base price\" then stackable = false always. If item base price is not defined, then this promotion is not applied. The item base price is equal to the value recorded for that item in price-promo>itemPrice>basePrice field Limited support:  This type of deal applies at the orderLine.  If multiple items are present on one orderline due to use of Quantity key, it is not possible to make separate 'best deal' determinations since all the items are on one line.  Lets take below example to understand this better. Promo Config Deal 1 Get 30% off selling price - If you buy 3 Menswear with coupon (GET30PER) Deal 2 Emp discount - 20% off Base Price (not stackable) \"Item A\" Item Prices Base Price is 100.00 Selling price is 85.00 Transaction - Buy 5 Mens shirts i.e. scan \"Item A\" and update quantity to 5 and present 1 coupon \"GET30PER\" Calculation: In theory, the Menswear deal should apply to 3 of them and the Emp discount off Base Price should apply to 2 of them. This would give max benefits i.e. Item A, Menswear quantity 5 Extended price 370.00. Desired 'optimal best deal' answer would be 3 for 85.00 with 30% off and 2 for 80.00 = 178.5+160= $338.50 This WOULD OCCUR if the 5 items were entered one at a time on 5 separate orderlines. Because all 5 items were grouped on one orderLine via Quantity key, they can't be split out as shown.  One of the two deals must be applied to the entire orderLine.  In this case only one promo will be applied i.e. “30% off selling price” promo because - given the all or nothing limitation - it gives relatively more but not 'optimal' benefit. All or Nothing Deal 1 - Five 85.00 items originally 100, for 30% off selling for three and two at selling = 3(59.5) + 2(85) = 178.5+170 = $348.50 - this is the deal that will be chosen. All or Nothing Deal 2 - Five 85.00 items originally 100, for 20% off base for all three = 5(80) = $400.00 - this will not apply User experience: This will only be used for calculation when \"Apply on Base Price\" = True. We will continue to not show Base Price for an item anywhere or retrieved into the cart. i.e. No changes proposed to receipt/UI presentation. In other words, we will continue to show existing selling price, charge amount, promo description, and extended amount.. Ex. If Base Price = 100, selling price = 75, and Base Price deal \"30% off Base Price\" is applied, the final price will show up as 70.00 which will look like 5.00 off 75.00, not 30.00 off 100.00.  Mathematically same result either way. On UI and on receipt, we will continue to show “Promotion Short Desc“ i.e. “30% off Base Price“. Therefore, Retailer should be sure to capture accurate detail in the promo short description as above, since the $100 (Base Price) deal basis is not shown on UI or receipts.  Otherwise customers may question why 30% only got them $5.00 off their $75.00 - the answer is, it was calculated on the BASE price (100) but that's not shown on UI or receipts.
