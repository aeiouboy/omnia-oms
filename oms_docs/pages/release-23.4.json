The Get Product List Availability API returns style availability across all locations, while the Get Store Product List Availability API returns style availability for one location (Shop By Store).&nbsp;This enables digital channels to seamlessly make real-time requests to Manhattan Active&reg; Omni and display the style availability and style-color availability directly on the Product List Page.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tip\"><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;This feature is controlled by a behavior change configuration which is disabled by default.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://omni.helpdocsonline.com/how-is-availability-computed$how-product-availability-works\">Shop By Store and Get Availability by Style</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/how-is-availability-computed$how-to-enable-product-availability\">Shop By Store and Get Availability by Style Configuration</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5><a name=\"alternate-store-availability\" id=\"alternate-store-availability\"></a><strong>Alternate Store Availability</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Drive additional conversion by displaying alternate nearby store availability when the customers&rsquo; preferred store is out of stock.

This also allows retailers to stock hot&nbsp;styles for in-store sales before being exposed to selling channels or to-hold early-arriving season products&nbsp;from being exposed to selling channels.&nbsp;Configuration is added to prevent inventory from being available online for a certain number of hours after being&nbsp;received.

Typically, the system ensures a valid authorization is always held, which leads to re-authorizing many times over this long lead time. However, authorization is only needed when we start the product. Manhattan Order Management can now delay the re-authorization until release to ensure we are not re-authorizing unnecessarily.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is driven&nbsp;at the order level and can be leveraged for orders that are authorized up front and should not be re-authorized until the unit(s) are eligible for release, or orders that are not authorized up front and should only attempt authorization when they are eligible for release.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tip\"><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp; This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Related:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://omni.helpdocsonline.com/how-release-works$authorization-on-release\">Order Release - Authorize Payment On Release</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://omni.helpdocsonline.com/authorization$authorization-on-release-for-pre-orders\">Payment - Authorize Payment on Release for Pre-Orders</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/order-orchestration-configuration$payment-configuration\">Authorize Payment on Release for Pre-Orders Configuration</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5><a name=\"currency-rounding\" id=\"currency-rounding\"></a><strong>Currency Rounding</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Retailers can now configure to round down the tax decimals once per invoice as per the new Japan tax laws.

Order Selling Adyen Integration for Payment Processing Adyen integration seamlessly comes pre-configured with Manhattan Active® Omni, extending its capabilities to handle various payment scenarios.This includes the processing of payments originating from external systems such as e-commerce, Point of Sale, Customer Service, and Digital Self Service. It supports a wide range of payment methods, including credit, debit, and gift cards, and offers the flexibility to incorporate additional payment types or custom processing logic. Note: This feature is controlled by configuration when using Adyen as a payment provider. Related: Adyen Payment Integration Adyen Integration for Payment Processing Configuration Authorize Payment on Release for Pre-Orders For pre-orders or other items with long lead times, it can take months between order capture and when the product gets shipped. Typically, the system ensures a valid authorization is always held, which leads to re-authorizing many times over this long lead time. However, authorization is only needed when we start the product. Manhattan Order Management can now delay the re-authorization until release to ensure we are not re-authorizing unnecessarily. This is driven at the order level and can be leveraged for orders that are authorized up front and should not be re-authorized until the unit(s) are eligible for release, or orders that are not authorized up front and should only attempt authorization when they are eligible for release. Note:  This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default.

Font normalization to ensure a consistent and appealing visual experience for the users. Streamlined display of Email/Text Message templates in the dropdown for each modification type in the Modification Rules UI; Now, only the relevant emails and texts are displayed for a given modification type.

Orders that only contain Omni items (shipping or BOPIS) items qualify for deposit. On the Order Summary screen, the user will apply a partial payment (deposit) to a qualifying order. In effect, the order can be confirmed with only partial payment and retrieved later. When the order is searched and retrieved later, the user can be informed that it is awaiting payment and from the Order Details screen, opt to go to the Order Summary screen and apply for another partial or full payment. Note: This feature is controlled by grant permission Related: Process UI Resources Allow Promo Proration independently for Multiple Redemptions Previously if the same BXGY type deal which is configured to PRORATE occurred more than once within the same order, the benefit amount prorated over all the players irrespective of the redemption instance.  For example, if Deal X causes 10.00 off based on qualifier A, target B, and 15.00 off qualifier C, target D, the 25.00 total would prorate over A, B, C, and D. If the new configuration is selected, the 10.00 and 15.00 in this example will prorate discretely - 10.00 over A,B and 15.00 over C,D. Mathematically, note that the customer receives 25.00 off either way.  This option just allows price presentation to be possibly less confusing, as in the event of a return. Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: Configuration Order and Orderline Promotional Attributes and Extended Attributes Promotion in MAO allows you to add customer and item extended attributes in the promo inclusion list, but the same was not true for orders. The application is enhanced to support order and order line extended attribute as promo qualifier inclusion. These attributes can either be base attributes or any extended attributes which are required to be configured as labels before using them. These labels will then be used for promotion qualifications. Note: Currently, exclusions are not supported for order and order line available types.  Also, all the labels are case-sensitive. For example - If you have configured CurrencyCode as USD in promotion inclusion and your order has CurrencyCode Usd, that order won't qualify for the promotion. The same applies to order line level promotions as well. Note: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Configuration POS App Reporting Reporting Framework and POS Z Report MAO-POS now features a framework to leverage Wiretap component to collect summary metrics on a schedule, and use these for reporting and dashboard-type display within the POS app. The POS end of day Z report is now available from the Backoffice - Reports menu.

Offline Application - Ability to Dismiss Online Alert Switch from the Offline App for Period of Time The newest version of the Offline POS Application allows the user to postpone online switch alerting. This feature is enabled via POS Store Config>Store Common Config>\"Online Switch Alert Dismiss Duration in Minutes\" and by installing the 23.4 version of the Offline POS Application. It allows the user to configure offline POS to notify when the network is available at the conclusion of a transaction - as with current functionality - but with new ability to 'dismiss' the reminder for a duration configured via this setting - ex. setting of 30 = \"no less than 30 minutes until the next reminder\". Related: Process Configuration Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is enabled by default. Resilient Cloud (\"Edge\") Server - Improved ability to detect Network/Cloud Availability Previously, the Resilient Cloud \"Edge\" server recorded successful \"network available\" status based on one successful heartbeat exchange in the past 15 minutes, and checked this availability every 5 minutes. We have enhanced this feature to check using a more sophisticated strategy - \"network available\" is now not recorded as \"success\" unless 3 successful 30 heartbeat exchanges AND a simple network speed test (using file UPLOAD and DOWNLOAD) are all performed. As well, the test will be run more frequently. This will help ensure that an 'available' Cloud network is stable and with sufficient bandwidth to truly support switching from the Offline POS App to the Online POS App.  This is available with the 23.4 version of the Edge Server. Related: Process Note: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Store Common Network Status on IT Health Dashboard The Store IT Health Dashboard is enabled to display network status and the number of network failures as part of the network status board.
