Today, in scenarios where a Requested Delivery Date cannot be met, committed delivery dates are computed based on the most pessimistic \"Last Possible Delivery Date\" on the order. With this feature, committed delivery dates are computed based on the first available inventory which can meet a date as close as possible to RDD. Also, retailers can choose to allocate a more assured inventory in scenarios where the Requested Delivery Date is approaching a certain configurable threshold from the current date. As part of this feature, the release date is also computed as the most optimistic release date where the first unit on the order line can be released, so that the partial units can be released as and when they are eligible. Note: This feature is controlled by an attribute in the save order interface Related: How Scheduling Works - Process How Scheduling Works - Configuration Allocate from Earliest Inventory when Requested Delivery Date is Approaching Retailers can choose to allocate a more assured inventory in scenarios where the Requested Delivery Date is approaching a certain configurable threshold from the current date. As part of this feature, the release date is also computed as the most optimistic release date where the first unit on the order line can be released, so that the partial units can be released as and when they are eligible. Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: How Scheduling Works - Process How Scheduling Works - Configuration Delivery Dates and Sustainability - Messaging \"Ship from Nearby Location\" A fulfillment will always have a lower carbon footprint if the origin of the shipment is within a local radius. In this release, the delivery date API response is enriched to display if the fulfillment center selected for a product or cart is \"local\" compared to the delivery address, and the notion of what qualifies as \"local\" is configurable. Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: Ship From Nearby Location - Configuration Delivery Dates - Support Requested Delivery Date Cart and Product ATP services are enhanced to support Requested Delivery dates at both header and line levels, thereby enabling backward scheduling which determines if the order can be fulfilled within the requested date. As part of the backward scheduling process, the pessimistic scheduling dates are calculated. Note: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Delivery Dates Services Continuous Allocation - De-Allocation Grace Period When orders are released to the fulfillment location based on a schedule, continuous allocation will allow for configurable minutes of grace period after the release process kicks off, thus preventing de-allocation of these orders right around the release schedule. Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: Grace Period Configuration Order Selling Optimized Return Routing Manhattan Active® Omni provides the flexibility to determine an optimized return center using reverse Adaptive Network Fulfillment (ANF). Retailers can configure incoming orders to go through the reverse ANF process to choose the most optimal return location, if the incoming order does not have a pre-determined return facility. For orders that come in with a pre-determined return facility, Active® Omni will honor it. Locations can be configured to accept returns and are optimized based on a new optimization factor \"Inventory Assortment\", in addition to the existing optimization factors available in forward promise. Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: Dynamic Return Routing - Process Dynamic Return Routing - Configuration How Returns Work Cancel Pending Returns Manhattan Active® Omni provides the flexibility to create new return orders by automatically canceling any pending return orders with the exception of store returns. Retailers can create return orders by canceling all the pending return orders or by canceling only the matching pending return items. Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: Cancel Pending Returns Tax Failover to Local Tax Manhattan Active® Omni provides the flexibility to allow quotation taxes to be retrieved from the local tax configuration in the event of a quotation tax call failure to a third party gateway, instead of placing the order on a 'tax service unavailable' hold. Orders with taxes created from local taxes are flagged for easy identification and can be reconciled in the tax ledger at a later date. This behavior is optional and controlled by configuration. Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: Tax Refund on Carrier Scan Manhattan Active® Omni provides the flexibility to refund the customer for returns early in the return order cycle when the return package/s is carrier scanned through an automatic return tracking process. This feature allows retailers to either chargeback or refund “more” depending on whether the received package(s) had fewer or more quantities respectively than what was scanned. Additionally, the contact center application is also enhanced to provide visibility for carrier-scanned status and chargeback invoices. Contact center agents also have the ability to mark orders as \"Received” to move items to final status in case the items were never received. Related: How Return Works Creating and Updating Order Return Variance Payment Configuration Invoicing and Salesposting Settlement Transactional Emails Transactional Texts Returns and Exchanges In Contact Center Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Payment Recovery for Auth Failures Authorization failures often require a substantial manual effort to be recovered, whether by cold-calling customers or writing off failed payments. Manhattan Active® Omni now provides the feature to increase authorization conversion rates by automatically retrying an authorization transaction for a configurable number of times in case of a failure. Additionally, retailers can configure Manhattan Active® Omni to email the customer to add a new payment from Digital Self-Service, for payments that can not be recovered through automatic retries. Note: These features are controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: Authorization Payment Extension Point Validation for Early Invoicing By using 'Payment:Payment:UserExit:EditPaymentTransactionInvoiceLinkRequest' UE request payload, specific invoices can be excluded from getting mapped to the closed payment transaction. For example, if a retailer has a process to manually approve an invoice for refund, this user exit can be used. Note: This feature is automatically available as part of the release. Miscellaneous Charge Type Exemption Miscellaneous charge types can now be exempted from specific order lines to allow invoicing of these charges only when specific items ship. In order to import, define which items should be exempt from such charges. Note: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Exempt Charges Google Shopping Integration - Order Tracking Signals Active® Omni now provides the ability to publish completed order shipment tracking data to Google Shopping to provide more precise estimates for specific product delivery times in Google Shopping. This feature integrates directly with the Google Order Tracking Signals service for customers with a registered Google Merchant Account. Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: Google Shopping Integration Payment Health Dashboard The Payment Health Dashboard provides broad metrics and KPI's using payment transactional data. The dashboard provides visibility into payments collected, payments that failed to process, and payments that are auto-recovered over a period of time. This provides insights on \"Where is the majority of sales coming from\", \"Which payment gateway is causing maximum failures\", \"How many failed payments am I recovering and from what channels\". Note: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Digital Self Service Order History: Managing My Orders With the growing number of Digital Self Service features, retailers now have the option to utilize a new Manage Orders page that consolidates available features for customer orders. When enabled, customers can access the Manage Orders page from transactional emails or from a retailer's website. For registered customers, a list of orders is displayed, in order by created date.

Note: This feature is enabled by permission. Related: POS Payment Process Store Common Store IT Health Dashboard A new dashboard has been created to allow the customer’s IT department to view the health status of their stores. The dashboard will inform the team about chain and store issues without having the store associates to notify the team about the issues. The issues will be divided into four areas: item entry, customer entry, payment and receipt. Based on a percentage of the store's transactions, if one of these areas is facing difficulties, the dashboard will display that area as experiencing issues or an outage. Note: This feature is controlled by permissions, and a configuration which remains disabled by default. Related: Store IT Dashboard Backoffice POS Store Open The Store Open functionality has been enhanced with respect to a scenario wherein the Store Open Date is configured to default from the local device system date. Previously, once the store open date was set by the local device, associates were left unable to re-open the store after it was closed for the day.  This causes inconvenience in exceptional scenarios, such as when the store is closed too early accidentally. With the new enhancements in place, associates will be able to re-open the store at a future date even if the store is closed for the current day. However, the store open functionality is limited only to the next business day, and users cannot select any random future date. To also minimize the possibility of accidental closure, if the users try to close the store before 3 PM on a given day, a warning message is displayed to let them know that they are closing the store before the configured time. Further, if the associates try to open the store on a future date, they will not be allowed to close the store until the store open date and the local device date are the same. Note: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release for those retailers who use this configuration. Related: Process Configuration POS Order Selling Tax on Demand Active® Omni now provides flexibility to calculate sales tax for items in a cart batchwise, on demand, suitable for retailers that do not need to display sales taxes as each item is added, but can wait until item entry is complete.  This will allow items to be added and identified/priced more quickly as the tax call will not occur with each and every barcode entry. Note: This feature is controlled by a configuration which is disabled by default. Related: Process Configuration Tax Failover to Local Tax Active® Omni provides the flexibility to allow quotation taxes to be retrieved from the local tax configuration in the event of a quotation tax call failure to a third party gateway, instead of putting the order on a 'tax service unavailable' hold.

Related: POS Cart Configuration Returns - Order Receipt Scan Attribute A new attribute \"order>orderCaptureDetail>receiptScanned\" has been added to provide some indication of receipt entry during a return. This attribute can be sent to loss prevention should they be interested in identifying orders containing returns for which no original receipt barcodes were scanned (example - returns initiated via handkey, or customer purchase history). If at least one receipt barcode (orderID) is entered by scanning, this new attribute will be saved as True.  Otherwise it will be False. Note: If at least one receipt barcode (orderID) is entered by scanning, this new attribute will be saved as true, otherwise it is false. This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Sales Metrics for Store Store users will be able to access key \"flash sales\" metrics on the store app to evaluate the store performance without leaving the application.  Sales metrics will be available on the cart, catalog and customer screens. The metrics data is for the current store and day (the logged-in store and current date) and it includes \"average sales for the day\", amount per transaction, \"units per transaction\" and \"% of transactions associated with the active customer\".

Store Count - For stores with both handheld and overhead RFID readers, recent reads from the overhead reader are automatically considered as counted by the store count. Store associates only need to count units which the overhead system has not recently read. A configuration defines how old an overhead last read date/time is considered before the tag’s coordinates are considered obsolete. View Inventory - From the View Inventory UI, store associates can now view a map with the location of units of an item based on the overhead coordinates. This can be used to find the nearest unit of an item, or to locate a unit which isn't where it should be.

Upon selecting this tile, the user can extend the database to suit their business needs. Flexible Database Attributes can also be added instead of using Database Attributes.  These attributes provide an alternative way to add a database extension without altering the database.  This is recommended for Component Entities where there will be a lot of attributes or transactions that will need to be processed. The final tile can be selected to add a Custom Index to the database for the component entity. The component entity can support up to 3 indexes which are represented visually on the tile. Upon selection of the tile, the user can add the indexes needed. Note that you can only index selective database attributes for indexing. Data attributes cannot be indexes."
