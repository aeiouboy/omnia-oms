When a customer arrives to pick the order, the staging location(s)&nbsp;where the inventory resides are presented to the associate to aid in locating the order. This can help&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;pickup transaction times and improve&nbsp;customer service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staging is relatively easier to implement as&nbsp;it does not require locations to&nbsp;be predefined in the system. Depending on the retailer&#39;s needs, staging locations can follow relatively simple (i.e., &quot;Behind counter 1&quot;) or complex naming conventions&nbsp;and can exist in barcoded&nbsp;or human readable formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staging is an optional process for both pickup and ship-to-store orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tip\">To know more on the&nbsp;staging activity during offline mode, please refer to the&nbsp;<a hqid=\"3324298\" href=\"/store-inventory-and-fulfillment-offline-support\">Store Offline Support</a>&nbsp;page.</div>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"initiation\" id=\"initiation\"></a>Initiation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For pickup orders, associates can perform staging during picking&nbsp;or later using the Stage Pickups menu option. For ship to store orders, staging can be done during receiving&nbsp;or later using the Stage Pickups menu option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through staging, the associate captures the staging location&nbsp;of the package/order.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><a name=\"pickup-orders\" id=\"pickup-orders\"></a><a id=\"Staging list\" name=\"Staging list\"></a>Pickup orders</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Staging for pickup orders&nbsp;is initiated from the list of ready to stage orders. If staging is not done immediately after Picking,&nbsp;the store associates can initiate staging from the ready to stage order list. Alternatively, one of the following search criteria can be used&nbsp;to lookup order(s) to stage:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>PicklistId</li>\r\n\t<li>OrderId</li>\r\n\t<li>FulfillmentId</li>\r\n\t<li>ItemId</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The staging list for pickup orders is displayed based on the parameter &quot;Stage Pickup - Display all fulfillments ready for staging&quot;. Refer to&nbsp;<a hqid=\"2687878\" href=\"/staging-configuration$Staging List\">Staging Configuration</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ready to stage orders list displays pickup orders in &quot;Picked&quot; status. &quot;Not staged&quot; orders are listed first in the ascending order of picked date and time, followed by staged orders&nbsp;in descending order of picked date and time. Staged orders are displayed so that the staging location can be changed if needed. The same sorting logic is applicable to the ready-to-stage list when the&nbsp;pick-to-slot parameter &quot;Pick to&nbsp;slot for pickups&nbsp;&quot; is turned on. Refer to&nbsp;<a hqid=\"1808784\" href=\"/fulfillment-picking-configuration$PickToSlot\">Picking Configuration</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Picker&#39;s first & last names&nbsp;are&nbsp;also available on the list for each order. If the&nbsp;first name and/or the&nbsp;last name&nbsp;is/are&nbsp;not&nbsp;configured, then the userId is displayed. Associate can select the order from the list and stage. &quot;listFulfillmentsForStaging&quot;&nbsp; API is used to list pickup orders for staging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Print all pickup slips option is available after the search criterion is applied.&nbsp;Print all pickup slips option is controlled by permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the staging process is optional for pickup orders, associates can choose to stage some or all of the picked orders, or can&nbsp;choose not to stage any orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><a name=\"search-options-for-staging-list\" id=\"search-options-for-staging-list\"></a>Search Options for Staging List</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Search can be performed by&nbsp;entering or scanning the Item / Item&nbsp;barcode, OrderId, Fulfillment Id or PicklistId. OrderId is available on the pickup slip, so if the pickup slip is already printed, the associate can&nbsp;enter the&nbsp;OrderId to stage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h6><a name=\"search-by-picklist-nbsp\" id=\"search-by-picklist-nbsp\"></a>Search By Picklist&nbsp;</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>For pickup orders, staging&nbsp;can be&nbsp;initiated at the picklist&nbsp;level. Once a picklist is selected,&nbsp;associates&nbsp;can stage the&nbsp;orders on the picklist. This is achieved with the&nbsp;List&nbsp;Fulfillments&nbsp;for Staging&nbsp;service, which returns a list of orders on the picklist. Once a list of orders is returned, associates perform staging for each order they would like to stage.&nbsp;The&nbsp;picklist&nbsp;must be completed&nbsp;for the picklist orders to be eligible for staging.&nbsp;If the&nbsp;picklist&nbsp;is slotted, the slot&nbsp;information&nbsp;is also presented to the associate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associates can immediately&nbsp;stage orders as picking is completed for a picklist, or can choose to stage orders for the picklist at a later time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the staging process is optional for pickup orders, associates can choose to stage some or all of the orders on a picklist, or can&nbsp;choose not to stage any orders on the picklist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If&nbsp;the &quot;Stage Pickup - Display all fulfillments ready for staging&quot; parameter is turned off,&nbsp;PicklistId is needed to start the staging process if staging is not done immediately after Picking through the interstitial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6><a name=\"search-by-order-nbsp\" id=\"search-by-order-nbsp\"></a>Search By Order&nbsp;</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>For pickup orders, staging can be initiated at the order or&nbsp;fulfillment level. Associates&nbsp;can search for&nbsp;the order or fulfillment from the ready-to-stage list and stage. This is achieved with the&nbsp;List&nbsp;Fulfillments&nbsp;for Staging&nbsp;service, which returns the corresponding fulfillment(s),&nbsp;if valid for staging. Once the fulfillment(s)&nbsp;are&nbsp;returned, associates can perform staging.&nbsp;If the&nbsp;fulfillment(s)&nbsp;are slotted, the slot&nbsp;information&nbsp;is also presented to the associate. If a valid fulfillment is not returned, then the appropriate message is displayed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associates can immediately&nbsp;stage&nbsp;an&nbsp;order&nbsp;as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;picking is completed, or can choose to stage&nbsp;at a later time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6><a name=\"search-by-item-nbsp\" id=\"search-by-item-nbsp\"></a>Search By Item&nbsp;</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>For pickup orders, staging can be initiated at the Item level. Associates&nbsp;can search for&nbsp;the orders containing&nbsp;a particular&nbsp;item,&nbsp;from a ready-to-stage list and stage. This is achieved with the&nbsp;List&nbsp;Fulfillments&nbsp;for Staging&nbsp;service, which returns the order(s) containing the item, if valid for staging. Once the orders are&nbsp;returned, associates can perform staging with one order at a time.&nbsp;If the&nbsp;orders are&nbsp;slotted, the slot&nbsp;information&nbsp;is also presented to the associate.&nbsp;If a valid order is not returned, then the appropriate message is displayed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associates can immediately&nbsp;stage&nbsp;an&nbsp;order&nbsp;as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;picking is completed, or can choose to stage orders&nbsp;at a later time based on item search.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><a name=\"ship-to-store-orders\" id=\"ship-to-store-orders\"></a>Ship-to-store orders</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>For ship-to-store orders, staging is initiated at the package level. Associates may invoke staging from the receiving UI, or can choose to stage the package at a later time after receiving has occurred. Staging screen lists all the pickup fulfillments that are not yet picked up.&nbsp;If an associate chooses to stage the ship-to-store order from the&nbsp;receiving interstitial screen,&nbsp;the list of orders for which a package was just received is&nbsp;displayed to the user to facilitate staging.&nbsp;Refer to the&nbsp;<a hqid=\"1855220\" href=\"/receiving-process\">Receiving process guide</a>&nbsp;for additional information.&nbsp;A complete list of ready-to-stage ship-to-store pickup fulfillments can also be accessed anytime as needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, based on the parameter &quot;Stage Ship to store - Display all fulfillments ready for staging&quot;, store associate can view the ready-to-stage ship-to-store pickup fulfillments list. This list also displays pickup leg fulfillments in &quot;Created&quot; status. Refer to&nbsp;<a hqid=\"2687878\" href=\"/staging-configuration$Staging List\">Staging Configuration</a>&nbsp;for more details about the parameter.&nbsp;&quot;Not staged&quot; orders are displayed first in the ascending order of received date and time (i.e.&nbsp;Picked date and time updated on Fulfillment Audit), followed by &quot;Staged&quot; orders in the desending order of received date and time. Ship to store pickup fulfillments can be staged from the list or a specific order can be searched using PackageId.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scanned package and other packages belonging to the same pickup fulfillment must be in &#39;Received&#39; status&nbsp;to stage the package. Fulfillment details are shown to the associate. When another package for the same pickup fulfillment is scanned, any existing staging&nbsp;locations are also displayed to help the associates stage them at the same place if possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scanned package and other packages belonging to the same pickup fulfillment must be in &#39;Received&#39; status&nbsp;to stage the package.

Multiple locations can be specified for an order&nbsp;if the inventory must be placed in multiple locations. Multiple orders can also be staged in the same staging location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once staged, associates&nbsp;can change&nbsp;the staging location(s) assigned to an order&nbsp;prior to customer pickup, provided the Picklist /Package is known for pickup / ship-to-store fulfillments respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tip\">Note: If the order has not been staged, at&nbsp;least 1 location is required to enable the &#39;Submit&#39; button.</div>\r\n\r\n<h5><a name=\"updates\" id=\"updates\"></a>Updates</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The Update Fulfillment service (for pickup orders) or Stage Ship-to-Store Orders&nbsp;service (for ship-to-store orders)&nbsp;updates the staging location(s) for the fulfillment.
