The dashboard provides visibility into payments collected, payments that failed to process, and payment recovered using features from the payment and digital self-service&nbsp;modules.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"what-is-tracked\" id=\"what-is-tracked\"></a>What is Tracked</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide insight on the high-level picture of payment processing for a selected organization for a particular day or&nbsp;series of days. Additionally, the dashboard provides different breakdowns of payment collection, failure, and recovery information to highlight the impact of the payment recovery features available for retailers using the payment module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aggregated payment data is stored for up to 1 year before it is purged. Although a wider range of days&nbsp;can be selected from the UI, the data displayed will apply only to payment&nbsp;transactions processed within the past 365 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following payment transactional information is referenced when compiling dashboard metrics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Payment Methods\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Captured payment tender origin source</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Payment type</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Payment Transactions\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Successful settlement transactions</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Failed settlement, refund, and authorization transactions</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Successful&nbsp;settlement and authorization&nbsp;transactions captured&nbsp;using Manhattan Active&reg; Omni payment recovery features</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(61, 61, 61); font-size: 20px;\">Process Flow</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The payment level metrics displayed on the dashboard are captured in real time when certain&nbsp;payment transactions are marked as&nbsp;closed and completed based on the payment gateway response. This data is then&nbsp;aggregated in a metrics table in the payment component. The aggregation model contains a metric name and a key-value pairing for the different payment metric breakdowns. Every metric is grouped by the date that the payment header was created to maintain the relationship of each money amount the metrics represent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The payment transactional data is compiled into a table for retrieval from the facade layer to the UI in the below structure:</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:749px;\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Name</strong></th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Description</strong></th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>metricName</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>The identifier for the metric displayed in the UI.

These leverage the field &quot;CapturedSource&quot; on the payment method object. To most accurately track dashboard metrics, it is recommended that the origin system populate this field when sending payment method details.&nbsp;When left blank, the dashboard will track the source of these payments as the selling channel of the corresponding&nbsp;order.&nbsp;In some cases this will have the same result from a dashboard perspective, e.g. orders captured with payment&nbsp;via Web. In some cases, however, the selling channel of the order and the captured source of the payment may differ, resulting in less accurate dashboard metrics. In the rare case that the selling channel of the order is not populated, the source of the payment will default to &quot;Web&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If payment capture is done using one of the following channels, the source of the payment method will be automatically tracked:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Manhattan POS</li>\r\n\t<li>Manhattan Contact Center - base hosted checkout</li>\r\n\t<li>Manhattan Digital Self-Service - base hosted checkout</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If payment capture is done using one of the following channels, the source of the payment method will NOT be automatically tracked, and the source of the payment method will be treated as the order selling channel to populate the dashboard metrics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Any external order/payment capture system</li>\r\n\t<li>Manhattan Contact Center - custom hosted checkout</li>\r\n\t<li>Manhattan Digital Self-Service - custom hosted checkout</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"configuration\" id=\"configuration\"></a>Configuration</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"grants\" id=\"grants\"></a><a id=\"grants\" name=\"grants\"></a>Grants</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To access the Payment Health&nbsp;Dashboard, the user should have access to the following grants:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>inventoryfacade::paymenthealthdashboard::view</strong>&nbsp;This will give the user, a menu option to access the dashboard.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>api::inventoryfacade::insightsmetrics</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The user should have access to this grant to load and view the dashboard.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"implementation-flavors\" id=\"implementation-flavors\"></a>Implementation Flavors</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"track-source-nbsp-data-when-using-a-custom-hosted-checkout\" id=\"track-source-nbsp-data-when-using-a-custom-hosted-checkout\"></a>Track source&nbsp;data when using a custom hosted checkout</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If a user exit or iFrame has been implemented to integrate with a hosted checkout payment provider that is not supported by base, the output of the user exit containing the new payment method to be added should populate the &quot;CapturedSource&quot; as either &quot;CallCenter&quot; or &quot;Digital Self-Service&quot;, depending on which source it originated from.
