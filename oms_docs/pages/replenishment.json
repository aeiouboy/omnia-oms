The objective of replenishment functionality is to have full assortment of products in front store, which results in minimal lost sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replenishment&nbsp;is supported for&nbsp;both RFID&nbsp;and non-RFID enabled stores. RFID replenishment generates a replenishment task when the inventory level for an item falls below its configured minimum selling area threshold. Non-RFID replenishment is intended for \"one out, one in\" replenishment use cases and are suited for stores which stock smaller quantities of items in the selling area. A store can use either RFID or non-RFID replenishment, but not both at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"rfid-replenishment-nbsp\" id=\"rfid-replenishment-nbsp\"></a>RFID Replenishment&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>RFID-enabled stores that count and track inventory at the sublocation level&nbsp;can automatically generate activities to replenish the front selling area from non-selling areas (i.e., the backroom.) The ability to automatically generate these replenishment activities&nbsp;allows stores to keep their selling areas fully stocked without the burden of manually identifying items that are running low in the sales floor and also present in the backroom.&nbsp;This functionality is achieved by tracking inventory at the sublocation level within&nbsp;the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A configuration defines the minimum number of units which should be present for an item in the store's selling area. If the inventory drops below this level and the item exists in the non-selling area, a replenishment activity is created.&nbsp;Store associates use a UI to view the list of items and quantities to replenish. Replenishment movements are completed using a handheld RFID reader.&nbsp;Multiple store associates can replenish the store simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Refer to the <a hqid=\"2195072\" href=\"/storerfid\">Store RFID guide</a> for additional information about RFID support in the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tip\"><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Currently, only one selling area and one non-selling area are supported. If more than one exists, the one that is created first is used.</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tip\">To learn&nbsp;more on the&nbsp;replenishment activity during offline mode, please refer to the&nbsp;<a hqid=\"3324298\" href=\"/store-inventory-and-fulfillment-offline-support\">Store Offline Support</a>&nbsp;page.</div>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"track-inventory-by-nbsp-sublocation\" id=\"track-inventory-by-nbsp-sublocation\"></a>Track Inventory by&nbsp;Sublocation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for the replenishment process to work effectively, inventory must be&nbsp;tracked at the sublocation level. Refer to the <a href=\"https://omni.helpdocsonline.com/store-count$counting-by-sublocation\">Store Count</a> guide for information on how to count&nbsp;at the sublocation level.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"minimum-quantity\" id=\"minimum-quantity\"></a><a id=\"minimum quantity\" name=\"minimum quantity\"></a>Minimum quantity</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The minimum quantity is the quantity the retailer wants to maintain for an item in the selling location of a store. When the replenishment engine evaluates an item, this is the quantity that it compares against the total quantity in the selling area. If the total quantity of the item in the selling area is less than the configured minimum quantity, then a replenishment task is created.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are two ways for a retailer to configure a minimum quantity - either through configurable rules or through a static configuration. See <a href=\"/replenishment$minimum quantity configuration\">Configuration section</a> below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"replenishment-activity-creation\" id=\"replenishment-activity-creation\"></a>Replenishment Activity Creation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Periodically (every 15&nbsp;minutes), a list of tags that were updated to or from \"Available\" status is evaluated.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If any of those tags correspond to an item that is on an open replenishment&nbsp;activity,\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>The quantity of the task is updated.&nbsp;The quantity is updated with the amount&nbsp;needed to bring the selling area up to the configured minimum or the quantity present in the non-selling area, whichever is less.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>If the quantity to update is less than or equal to 0, the activity&nbsp;is deleted.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Else, if the item's inventory&nbsp;in the selling area sublocation is less than&nbsp;the configured minimum quantity (see <a href=\"/replenishment$minimum quantity configuration\">Configuration section</a> below) and has inventory in the non-selling area,\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>A new replenishment activity is created and updated using&nbsp;the same quantity logic as above.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some examples.

Non-RFID replenishment solution is intended for \"one out, one in\" replenishment use cases and are not suited for stores which stock large unit quantities of items in the selling area who would want to wait to trigger replenishment until inventory falls to a minimum level. The&nbsp; transactions on store front, that would trigger the replenishment task creation are: POS Sales/Store Sale,&nbsp; BOPIS picking and Shipment Order picking (Ship To Address and Ship To Store).

The objective of replenishment functionality is to have full assortment of products in front store, which results in minimal lost sale. Replenishment is supported for both RFID and non-RFID enabled stores. RFID replenishment generates a replenishment task when the inventory level for an item falls below its configured minimum selling area threshold. Non-RFID replenishment is intended for \"one out, one in\" replenishment use cases and are suited for stores which stock smaller quantities of items in the selling area. A store can use either RFID or non-RFID replenishment, but not both at the same time. RFID Replenishment RFID-enabled stores that count and track inventory at the sublocation level can automatically generate activities to replenish the front selling area from non-selling areas (i.e., the backroom.) The ability to automatically generate these replenishment activities allows stores to keep their selling areas fully stocked without the burden of manually identifying items that are running low in the sales floor and also present in the backroom. This functionality is achieved by tracking inventory at the sublocation level within the store. A configuration defines the minimum number of units which should be present for an item in the store's selling area. If the inventory drops below this level and the item exists in the non-selling area, a replenishment activity is created. Store associates use a UI to view the list of items and quantities to replenish. Replenishment movements are completed using a handheld RFID reader. Multiple store associates can replenish the store simultaneously. Refer to the Store RFID guide for additional information about RFID support in the store. Note: Currently, only one selling area and one non-selling area are supported. If more than one exists, the one that is created first is used. To learn more on the replenishment activity during offline mode, please refer to the Store Offline Support page. Track Inventory by Sublocation In order for the replenishment process to work effectively, inventory must be tracked at the sublocation level. Refer to the Store Count guide for information on how to count at the sublocation level. Minimum quantity The minimum quantity is the quantity the retailer wants to maintain for an item in the selling location of a store. When the replenishment engine evaluates an item, this is the quantity that it compares against the total quantity in the selling area. If the total quantity of the item in the selling area is less than the configured minimum quantity, then a replenishment task is created.  Currently, there are two ways for a retailer to configure a minimum quantity - either through configurable rules or through a static configuration. See Configuration section below. Replenishment Activity Creation Periodically (every 15 minutes), a list of tags that were updated to or from \"Available\" status is evaluated. If any of those tags correspond to an item that is on an open replenishment activity, The quantity of the task is updated. The quantity is updated with the amount needed to bring the selling area up to the configured minimum or the quantity present in the non-selling area, whichever is less. If the quantity to update is less than or equal to 0, the activity is deleted. Else, if the item's inventory in the selling area sublocation is less than the configured minimum quantity (see Configuration section below) and has inventory in the non-selling area, A new replenishment activity is created and updated using the same quantity logic as above. Here are some examples. For all examples, the minimum quantity in the selling area is configured to 5. Example 1: A new replenishment activity is created Before After Selling area quantity 5 4 Non-selling area quantity 10 10 Replenishment quantity N/a 1 A unit of the item was sold from the selling area. Since the new item quantity in the selling area is less than the minimum quantity (4 < 5) and the item quantity in the non-selling area is greater than 0, the item is added to the replenishment task with a quantity of 1. Example 2: Increase quantity of existing replenishment activity Before After Selling area quantity 4 3 Non-selling area quantity 10 10 Replenishment quantity 1 2 Continuing with the same example, before the first replenishment is completed, another unit of the item is sold. Since the item quantity in the selling area is less than the minimum quantity(3 < 5) and the item quantity in the non-selling area is greater than 0, the quantity of the open replenishment activity is increased by 1 to 2. Example 3: Increase quantity of existing replenishment activity Before After Selling area quantity 3 2 Non-selling area quantity 10 10 Replenishment quantity 2 3 Continuing with the same example, before the first replenishment is completed, a third unit of the item is sold. Since the item quantity in the selling area is less than the minimum quantity (2 < 5) and the item quantity in the non-selling area is greater than 0, the quantity of the open replenishment activity is increased by 2 to 3. Example 4: Decrease quantity of existing replenishment activity Before After Selling area quantity 2 4 Non-selling area quantity 10 10 Replenishment quantity 3 1 Continuing with the same example, before the first replenishment is completed, two units of the item are returned and inventory added to the sales floor. Since the item quantity in the selling area is less than the minimum quantity (4 < 5) and the item quantity in the non-selling area is greater than 0, the quantity of the open replenishment activity is reduced from 3 to 1. Example 5: Delete existing replenishment activity Before After Selling area quantity 4 4 Non-selling area quantity 10 0 Replenishment quantity 1 N/a Continuing with the same example, before the first replenishment is completed, all ten units of the item in the non-selling area are transferred to another store. Since the item quantity in the non-selling area is now 0, the replenishment activity is deleted. Replenishment Execution The Replenishment UI displays the list of items to replenish from the non-selling to the selling area. Key information such as item information, required quantity and scanned quantity is displayed. Associates use the handheld reader to read the tags that they are gathering for replenishment. Refer to the UI permissions for the resources needed for this function. The UI initially loads 20 records. Associates can scroll down to load the next 20 records and so on as needed. Note : Tags can be read on the Replenishment UI during intermittent connectivity, but connectivity is required for most functions including initial UI loading, scroll down, filtering, sorting and submit. Note: The item must be visible (or loaded) on the UI in order for the tag to be read. This applies to lists over 20 records long that require scrolling down as well as when a filter or sort is updated and the UI is refreshed. Updates Once the associate has physically moved the items to the selling area, they press Submit which completes the replenishment process. Based on the tags that are read, a validation is performed to confirm that each item is still eligible to be replenished. It is possible that during the time since the UI was last loaded an item could have been removed from the list because the replenishment is no longer needed, the inventory in the backroom has been used for another purpose or the activity was completed by another associate (see Multiple Associates section.) If an replenishment activity for an item that the asociate has read is no longer open, upon Submit the associate will receive the \"One or more items are not eligible to replenish\" error message. The associate must refresh the Replenishment screen in order to get the most current list and then can re-scan their items. The following updates are performed on pressing Submit: The sublocation in the Unit Inventory record each is updated to the selling area for each read tag. Replenishment activity updates: If the number of tags read is greater than or equal to the quantity to replenish, the activity is deleted Otherwise (the number of tags read is less than the replenish quantity), the quantity is reduced and the activity remains open. The item will remain on the open activity list and appear the next time an associate opens the Replenishment UI.

Profile purposes to copy from base to custom profile sto::storeConfig, srf::rfConfig, srf::messaging, srf::processDefinition The configuration below can be enabled for all stores in the organization, or can be overridden at the store profile type or location level. Refer to the Config UI guide for additional details. Replenishment UI Refer to the Store RFID guide here. Enable Store Front Replenishment The configuration controls whether the logic to evaluate item minimums and create replenishment activities is enabled or disabled. This configuration is available in the Store RFID Configuration UI and is disabled by default. Configuration Name: Enable Store Front Replenishment Minimum quantity configuration There are two different ways to configure a minimum quantity which should exist in the selling area for each item in the store. Replenishment Rule Retailers can define minimum quantities for items based on item characteristics using the Replenishment Rule configuration UI. Retailers can create rules using combinations of item attributes and assign a minimum quantity for each rule. If an item satisfies a rule, then the configured minimum quantity for the rule is used as the minimum quantity. If an item satisifes multiple rules, the highest priority rule is selected. Retailers can create up to 20 replenishment rules. The following attributes are supported: Item Color Item Size Item Style Item Product Class Item Department Note: The following maximum limits that are supported: 1) A single rule can have up to 5 conditions defined (across all groups); and 2) When using the IN or NOT IN operators, a maximum of 20 value are supported. Sample rules: ProductClass IN ('Shirts','T-shirts','Tops') AND Department IN ('Men', Boys', Kids') -> Minimum Quantity = 3 Size IN (6,7,8) AND Department IN ('Shoes') -> Minimum quantity = 2 Global Minimum Quantity This is a static value which applies to all items in the store. If a matching rule is not found for an item, the global minimum value is used. This configuration is available in the Store RFID Configuration UI and is set to null (i.e., disabled) by default. Configuration Name: Minimum Item Quantity Non-RFID Replenishment This functionality provides capability to replenish/restock items on store front from back room after any sales/picking transaction in non-RFID scenario. It serves an objective to automatically generate replenishment tasks to restock/replenish items on front store so that the front store has full assortment of products and translates to minimal lost sale. Non-RFID replenishment solution is intended for \"one out, one in\" replenishment use cases and are not suited for stores which stock large unit quantities of items in the selling area who would want to wait to trigger replenishment until inventory falls to a minimum level. The  transactions on store front, that would trigger the replenishment task creation are: POS Sales/Store Sale,  BOPIS picking and Shipment Order picking (Ship To Address and Ship To Store). Please refer to configurations for setting it up. Note: Unlike RFID replenishment, the non-RFID replenishment task creation is near real-time and there is no batching delay. Replenishment Task Creation on the Replenishment UI The Replenishment UI lists the products and their respective quantities that would need to be moved from back to front store called replenishment tasks. POS Store sale generates inventory relay messages and BOPIS/Shipment Order pickups generate pick event messages with qty of item sold/picked(Requested Qty) during the transaction. If an item is sold/picked and item's OHA > 0, replenishment task is created for the item as per the replenishment request quantity to move a replacement unit to the sales floor. If the replenishment task already exists for the item, the quantity of the existing replenishment task gets updated and new replenishment request quantity gets added to the existing quantity.  No minimum configured item thresholds on front store is required. There is an additional  check  to decide whether a complete quantity replenishment task or a partial quantity replenishment task will be created depending on the requested quantity on inventory relay event message or pick event messages: a) Complete Quantity Replenishment Task is created if Requested Quantity<=OHA inventory. Here, the Replenishment Task is created, with UnitsToReplenish qty equal to the Requested quantity for the item. b) A Partial Quantity Replenishment task for an item is created, if Requested Quantity>OHA inventory. Here, the partial quantity Replenishment Task is created, with UnitsToReplenish qty equal to the OHA inventory quantity for the item. Non-RFID Replenishment for Supersessions: For BOPIS orders fulfilled by supersession qtys, different non-RFID replenishment tasks will be created for ordered items and for the supersession items. After the replenishment tasks are created for ordered and for supersession items,  the store associate can replenish the items on the Replenishment UI. Task Submission After the replenishment task is created the store associate can replenish the items on the Replenishment UI. Associates can either use scanning (camera/device) or manual input of item barcode in replenishment UI textbox to replenish an item. They can replenish an item underage(lesser than UnitsToReplenish qty), completely (equal to UnitsToReplenish qty) or overage (greater than UnitstoReplenish qty). After they are done scanning/inputting the item to the replenishment task, they can hit submit. Upon which, they will observe the replenishment success screen with the units replenished. From this screen they can either choose to replenish more items and land back on the replenishment UI or they can navigate to home page. Non-RFID Replenishment Configuration Ensure that the purposes listed below have been copied from the base profile to your custom profile Profile purposes to copy from base to custom profile sim::messaging, ful::messaging, srf::messaging There are two configurations (business flags) that control Non-RFID Replenishment Task Creation on Replenishment UI. These are: a) Configuration 1: ‘Enable Store Front Replenishment' flag in Store Inventory Parameters (Default: False). i) If the flag is enabled, menu link for replenishment (Non RFID mode) on store application home page is displayed. Also, replenishment tasks will be created for POS sales. Replenishment tasks for BOPIS and shipment order transactions are only created if 'Generate replenishment for picking' flag is true. ii) If the flag is not enabled, replenishment tasks will not be created for POS Sale. Non-RFID replenishment menu link is not displayed on store app's home page. b) Configuration 2: 'Generate replenishment for picking' flag in Store Fulfillment parameters (Default: False). This business parameter denotes whether picking of BOPIS/Shipment order generates replenishment task or not. i) If this flag is enabled, replenishment tasks are created for the BOPIS/Shipment Order transactions. ii) If this flag is not enabled, replenishment tasks are not created for BOPIS/Shipment Order transactions. Note: The existing \"Enable RFID Store Front Replenishment\" business flag should be disabled for Non-RFID replenishment flow to work. If \"Enable RFID Store Front Replenishment\" is enabled, then RFID replenishment business flow will work on the replenishment UI. Additionally, RFID flows should be disabled for prepare pickups and prepare shipments flows in Store RFID parameters for non-RFID replenishment flow to work for BOPIS and Shipment Order flows. Additionally, to enable creation of non-RFID Replenishment Tasks for POS Transactions/POS Sale, the Inventory Transaction Type should be created for POS Sale. To create an Inventory Transaction Type for POS Sale follow the below steps: a) On the omnifacade MUP UI, open the \"Inventory Transaction Type Relay Config\" page. b) Hit Create and create Inventory Transaction Type as \"POS Sale\" and hit save. c) A new inventory Transaction Type relay for POS Sale will be created on UI with created date/time stamp. Common RFID/Non-RFID Replenishment Functions The following functions are available for both RFID and non-RFID replenishment. Filter The replenishment list can be filtered by department or style. Associates can filter by departments and styles that are associated with open replenishment activities. When a filter is applied, changed or cleared, the UI is reloaded with the first 20 matching records based on the filter criteria. Associates can scroll down to load the next 20 records and so on as needed. Sort The replenishment list can be sorted by department or style, with an ascending or descending sort available for each. The default sort which is applied when initially entering the UI or if the sort is cleared is by item ID. When a sort is applied, changed or cleared, the UI is reloaded with the first 20 records based on the sort criteria. Associates can scroll down to load the next 20 records and so on as needed. Multiple Associates Two or more associates can work on the same replenishment list at the same time. Because a store associate's UI is not updated with the real-time progress from other users, it is recommended that associates collaborate offline so that they do not work on the same item. If they are working on different items on the list, they can read tags/scan barcodes and submit independently. If two or more associates work on the same item, the reads are captured for both associates. When the first user presses Submit, all reads/scans up until that point are updated and the task quantity is updated. If this results in the activity being closed, when the second associate attempts to Submit they will receive an error message stating that \"One or more items are not eligible to replenish\". The second associate must refresh the Replenishment screen in order to get the most current list and then can re-scan their items. Exceptions Quantity Difference Store associates can replenish fewer units or more units than displayed in the task based on their experience and discretion, considering factors such as space and inventory levels in the front and back rooms. The partially completed task will remain open until it is fully completed, canceled or purged. Missing Items Associates can choose whether they want to replenish all items on the list or only some. Any items that are not read/scanned will remain on the open activity list and appear the next time an associate opens the Replenishment UI. Additional items If the store associate reads a tag/scans a barcode for an item that is not part of the current list, an error message is displayed. In order to read/scan an item's tag/barcode, it must be a part of an open replenishment activity and be loaded onto the UI. Task Cancelation The store associates can choose to cancel a partially (underage) replenished task or an unpicked replenishment tasks if they don't have inventory in back room to replenish the item and they don't want the task to remain idle on the replenishment UI. They can cancel the task using cancel button on replenishment task. Cancel button is revealed on left swipe gesture of replenishment task on replenishment UI. Upon clicking the button the task is canceled and will no longer be shown on Replenishment UI. Cancel action is resource protected, please refer to Store Inventory UI Resources page. Leave UI If the user navigates away from the Replenishment UI prior to submitting, any tag reads/barcodes scanned are cleared from the device and will need to be redone. Purging of Replenishment Tasks Purge date is the date on which the Replenishment Task will auto-close. Current default Purge date for a RFID/non-RFID replenishment task is 5 days from the day of creation, after which the task will auto-close and no longer be shown on the replenishment UI. Partially submitted(underage) or unpicked replenishment tasks will be removed from the UI on purge date, if the associates haven't canceled them already. Troubleshooting Issue Troubleshooting Tip The Replenishment menu does not appear 1. Confirm that the user has the appropriate UI permission. See link here. 2. For non-RFID replenishment, confirm that the \"Enable Store Front Replenishment\" business flag is enabled. The last unit of the item is sold in the selling area, but the item does not appear in the replenishment UI (applicable to RFID replenishment only) 1. Does the item have available units in the non-selling area? Replenishment task is only created if the item has at least 1 unit in available status in the non-selling area. 2. Has it been at least ten minutes since the item changed status in the selling area? Any item eligible for evaluation for replenishment is added to a de-duplication queue and is processed after 15 minutes to enable consolidation. 3. Check if the  inbound and outbound message type UpdateReplenishmentEvent is available in the custom profile Note: Ensure that the Profile Purpose ID \"srf::messaging\" is copied from the base profile to the custom profile. 4. Check if the  extPointToMessageType UpdateReplenishmentEvent is available in the custom profile Note: Ensure that the Profile Purpose ID \"srf::processDefinition\" is copied from the base profile to the custom profile.
