This enables you to understand the availability picture when this configuration is activated. Viewing item metrics in report Provides the detailed report for important statistics of items included/will be included in the configuration. The heading in the report will be as follows Active Configuration Non Active Configuration Items included in view Items will be included in the view The important metrics for items are: Total items in the network verses items included in the configuration. Division of the count of items in the configuration by each facility type. Division of count of items in the configuration by each rule set for the facility type selected. Items selection for Configuration This displays a comparison of the items that are included in the configuration out of the total items available in the network. The graphical representation is defined as illustrated in table below. Properties Value X Axis The X-axis displays the following Total Items: It is total number of items that have at least one valid inventory record. Included in view: It is the total count of items that are included in the view.
