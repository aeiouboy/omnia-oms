Upon the first login of the day, essential configurations are stored locally on the device. For any following logins by the same user, the system bypasses API calls and instead uses this local data to immediately navigate to the specified screen. Direct login and navigation to a store page currently apply only to the cart screen.  We do not support direct navigation on login to any other Store screens at this time.

Related: Customer Notes Google API refactoring The application is enhanced to assist the user to enter the address for customers by providing suggestions based on the response from Google address search if a Google account is registered for this service. When the user enters the Street Address 1 for the customer, the Store UI makes a call to Google API via the Storefacade and generates the address suggestion for the details entered. Google APIs are currently supported for address autocomplete only. A static API is required to be linked to the Google Account used for making the GooglePlaces API call, which will be required by the services team to configure. Google plans to deprecate the Google Maps API in the near future, with the Google Places API set to replace it.  This change was done to adopt the new Google Places API to the Manhattan Active® Point of Sale.

This capability is applicable during the sale or return of an item. Enablement: This feature is controlled by configuration that is disabled by default. Related: Linked Item Linked Item Configuration Payment Improvements Migration of base payments to payment forms The application has been improved to streamline payment processing behavior and flow between base payment types (Credit, Check, Cash) and custom payment types. With this enhancement, base payment types now also utilize the payment forms architecture to orchestrate the payment flow. This change eliminates payment type-specific capabilities, making the application run purely based on configuration. This change is not supported for payment types that use the cloud implementation. The gift card payment flow is not altered with this enhancement. Enablement: This feature is controlled by Behavior Change timer, \"POS - Migrate base payments to payment form\". It will be released in production environments on August 15, 2026, but you can opt-in earlier. Please refer to the behavior change document here for additional information on this process and to learn how to take advantage of this feature early for testing and training. Related: Payment Forms Payment Forms Configuration Improved Payment Failure Handling Several improvements were made to improve the payment process, in the event of a payment failure. A close button is introduced on the gift card activation screen when attempting to refund a gift card. When the payment is processed during a sale or refund, in case of any API timeouts / failures, the application allows the user to explicitly refresh the payment information. This will prevent the user from seeing stale payment information on the order.

Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Close Button Cart Refresh On Failures Partial Payment Capture Enhanced Payment Animation The POS application shows a card swipe animation when selecting a base payment type like a credit card. The animation is shown to the user when the application interacts with the payment terminal and expects the user to complete the payment on the payment terminal.  The existing animation is enhanced for a better user experience and optimized for all form factors. The animation can now also be configured to show for any payment type. The customer also now has the flexibility to replace the animation with any custom animation by supplying the animation file. Enablement: This feature is automatically enabled as part of the release. Related: Payment Animation Configuration Deferred Order Confirmation The last step of the transaction in the application today is marking the order as confirmed. There are multiple business processes that look for order confirmation to treat the order as complete. However, we do notice instances where the order is fully paid for but confirmation fails due to network issues or temporary API failures. The application is now enhanced to attempt confirmation asynchronously if the synchronous confirmation times out or fails. Enablement: This feature is controlled by the Behavior Change timer, \"POS - Asynchronous Order Confirmation\". It will be released in production environments on August 15, 2026, but you can opt in earlier. Please refer to the behavior change document here for additional information on this process and to learn how to take advantage of this feature early for testing and training. Related: Delay Receipt and Asynchronous order confirmation Support Payment Forms In Automatic Refunds The application is enhanced to open the payment forms and allow the user to input payment information during the automatic refund process. This is controlled by a new flag, which, when enabled, allows the form to be used in the automatic refund flow. Enablement: This feature is controlled by configuration that is disabled by default. Related: Refund - Payment Forms Refund - Payment Forms Configuration Payment Reconciliation - Using Last Transaction The payment processing in the application is hardened to handle communication failures and perform a real-time transaction search in the payment gateway before attempting a new payment request to the gateway. This feature is supported for both sales and returns. If the application initiates a payment capture or refund call to the terminal and there is a delay in the response, a last transaction call is made from the application to check if the terminal has processed the request. If the last transaction call also fails, a communication error is sent back to the application. If the user tries to re-run the same payment transaction, the application will first make a last transaction call to check the status of the previous attempt. If the last transaction call is successful, the payment is automatically updated in the application, and the customer does not need to swipe their card again. This feature is only supported for the Payware gateway. Enablement: This feature is now available and is planned to be automatically enabled as part of the upcoming 25.4 market release. If you would like to opt in early, contact your Manhattan representative.
