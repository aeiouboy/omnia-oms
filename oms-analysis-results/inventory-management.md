# Inventory Management

## What It Does
Manhattan ActiveÂ® Omni Enterprise Inventory provides retailers with a complete, real-time view of perpetual inventory across every fulfillment location in the enterprise. The system manages inventory across stores, warehouses, distribution centers, in-transit shipments, on-order inventory, and third-party owned/fulfilled inventory. Using open APIs, it synchronizes inventory positions across the retailer's network and external applications in real time, delivering the global view of inventory needed to power omni-channel commerce. The system supports complex allocation strategies, real-time availability computation, and intelligent demand-supply matching for optimal inventory utilization.
